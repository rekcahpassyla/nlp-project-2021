]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s something about McDonalds which brings forth the beast in the great unwashed masses.</p>
<p>Not only does the fast food restaurant feed the people with their daily mush, it is a conduit for extreme violence, most of the time highly entertaining gladiatorial combat that ends up  on YouTube.</p>
<p>Over the years the restaurant has tried to clean up its image, and has refurnished their restaurants to try to appeal to a better clientele, however this has mostly failed because the food they serve only applies itself to the lowest common denominator.</p>
<p>Processed shit for the Untermensch is a big money maker, and there will never be any escape for the company in this respect.</p>
<p>The only solution obviously is to put armed guards in every restaurant outlet. This way, when the ratchets start their screeching and hair pulling, and the gang boys start their fist fights, there could be a lot of tomato ketchup splattered all over the walls as the armed guards let loose. McDonalds employees beating customers with their fists, although entertaining, is less effective than guns.</p>
<p>Amongst the wreckage, the discarded hair weaves, the ripped thongs, the McDonalds sign shines down from above, an unholy reminder that in satan&#8217;s kitchen, money is made despite the brutal violence. Business carries on as they mop up the shit and the blood from the floor and walls. Cha ching!</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>The shameful British have forgotten how to rule themselves, they have been slaves for so long to Brussels. Theresa May, the current PM, is an insipid scrawny grey pustule who could not make a deal with a paper bag let alone a coterie of unelected officials from the EU.</p>
<p>Watching the inspiring speech by Trump on Thursday regarding the reintroduction of manufacturing of steel back into the USA was a momentous moment for many workers who have been bypassed by the likes of Obama who favoured communist China over American workers. Trump, much to the chagrin of the American socialists is actually making a difference to many peoples&#8217; lives.</p>
<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Syzo-6dMoso" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trump&#8217;s earlier meeting with Juncker sealed further trade concessions from the EU, in just a few hours of talks. Something the timid, listless British cannot do as they cower in the corner scared to even utter a word to their EU masters.</p>
<p>Britain indeed is a country enslaved for so long it has a case of Stockholm Syndrome. If the British had an ounce of the balls that Trump has we would have been out of the EU prison a long time ago, instead Britain kowtows to every Brussels demand and is left in a shameful imbroglio, as the likes of Michel Barnier tighten their octopus grip over the imprisoned country.</p>
<p>Britain, infected by the treachery of Remoaners, people who actively seek to do harm to the country by sabotaging every attempt to leave the EU protectionist racket, and its totalitarian Sovietized ideology are a testament that there are many Marxists within the British Isles. One day hopefully they will be rooted out and made to pay for their crimes.</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t we hire Trump for at least one hour to go at it at the EU? He would no doubt stride into the meeting, slap something on the table, then say take it or leave it. The EU would capitulate or be thrown into total disarray. This is how Trump would negotiate with the EU, who are using Britain&#8217;s cowardice and negativity to great effect.</p>
<p>Apart from a few Brexiteers in parliament, no one has any balls anymore. Even the grandchild of Churchill, the bloated cochon Soames has been paid off by the EU and would <a href="https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/18867-boris-johnson-leaked-serco-letter-biggest-stitch-since-bayeux-tapestry.html">sell off Britain at the drop of a hat</a>. How ironic that Soames is now a Haw Haw. Winston Churchill most certainly did not give him any balls down the line, as he waddles around the Commons floor like a fat cheap whore on the take. That spinning sound you hear when Soames speaks is the sound of his grandfather in his grave.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/16803-what-churchill-really-thought-of-the-european-union.html">Winston Churchill&#8217;s vision of the EU</a> was one led by Britain and France, and not Germany, and this is the crux of the matter. Whilst Britain was a member of the EU it had no say, and no power.</p>
<p>If no one steps up soon to delete Theresa May, and her Remoaners, all will be lost. All hope, all chance of freedom, all national pride, but it seems that Britain had little or no national pride anyway.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>What could you do with more than $125 billion? A lot, you say. Well, $125 billion just disappeared off <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/25/tech-stocks-poised-for-bloodbath-on-thursday-with-facebook-on-track-fo.html">Facebook&#8217;s value</a> in a few minutes after its QE2 earnings came through and a new censorship drive was pushed through.</p>
<p>Much of the loss for these FANG stocks will be the precursor for more falls as time goes by, because investors have been hit hard with the fall. No one with a brain or a wallet wants to touch these stocks, simply because of the climate we are in now.</p>
<p>On the bright side, at least Zuckerberg burned a new U.S record. The one day drop of Facebook was the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/26/facebook-on-pace-for-biggest-one-day-loss-in-value-for-any-company-sin.html">highest stock market single day loss</a> in known American history.</p>
<p><strong>Socialists are meant to be inclusive</strong></p>
<p>This climate is an Orwellian deluge of mass censorship, mass deletions, and un-inclusivity. What the socialists who run these tech media companies do not realise is that they are censoring the spice that made their boring formats exciting. Anyone with an education and logical thought process can see if a post is rather iffy or outrageous, but they watch the videos for entertainment purposes. There is no need to censor something purely because it does not conform to socialist political ideals.</p>
<p>There has been mass censorship of all conservative views on these platforms, there has also been shadow-banning, and mass deletions of accounts that did not conform to the communistic views of the controllers in charge.</p>
<p>What we have now is a completely one-sided platform on places like YouTube and Facebook, where anything with an alternative view is labelled as &#8216;hate speech&#8217; then removed.</p>
<p><strong>Orwellian Thoughtcrime</strong></p>
<p>Defining &#8216;hate speech&#8217; is a difficult proposal, but much can be plonked into its allocation folder. Much like George Orwell&#8217;s 1984, we are seeing anything that does not hold the American democratic socialist party&#8217;s line of thought as &#8216;hate speech&#8217;.</p>
<p>By removing the essence of discussion, of opposing views, you see a decline in conversation, a fall in debate, and thus these platforms are now merely propaganda machines for the American socialists to feed off each other as everyone else is excluded from the debate.</p>
<p>To question something is now deemed as &#8216;hate crime&#8217; because the questioning goes against the narrative or socialist conditioning that is constantly put out by the tech companies and the socialist controlled media.</p>
<p>Censorship kills discussion, censorship kills art, and censorship kills the fundamental reason why the internet, world wide web was created. Berners-Lee surely would agree?</p>
<p><strong>Censoring formerly protected genres</strong></p>
<p>Google has even severely censored the Daily Squib, which is an essentially satirical parody news format, and in history satire/parody has only been heavily censored by totalitarian communist and fascist regimes. We can therefore surmise, that this time we are living in is one of a totalitarian regime, where even the supposedly protected genre of satire is attacked. Our YouTube channel which we stopped using, was shadow-banned years ago. There is no point in posting a video on the channel because it will not get any views anymore. We tested this by uploading one of our videos onto a new created account with a different name and it immediately received tens of thousands of views. The original video in our official account got 120 views over five years. This is the level of censorship we are dealing with, where creativity, innovation and alternative views are crushed to leave a bland landscape of &#8216;yes men&#8217;, a hive like culture where everyone says the same thing and thinks in the same way. Humanity never progressed much when everyone said the same thing, and everyone agreed. Fuck that!</p>
<p>What these tech companies are essentially doing is <a href="https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/27723-communist-china-behind-google-facebook-global-censorship-push.html">aligning themselves with communist China</a> and its censorship technique. Facebook is itching to get into the Chinese market, therefore they are aligning themselves with the same communist ideals as the Chinese.</p>
<p>One can only hope that the censors bring these FANG stocks, and the rest of the fucking NASDAQ down by another 40-60%.</p>
<p>Let us see how your censorship works then you socialist &#8216;inclusive&#8217; controllers of all media.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>With 39 signatures already lodged by backbenchers to dump Theresa May in a vote of no confidence, May&#8217;s act of sheer stupidity and arrogance is of stripping the Brexit department of any responsibility in EU negotiations and appointing Remainer, lickspittle Olly Robbins in charge of everything.</p>
<p>The PM cannot be trusted, as she has been proven to be a liar and deceitful snake by trying to push through the Olly Robbins penned Chequers Brino proposal.</p>
<p><strong>Corruption</strong></p>
<p>The announcement was sneaked in just minutes before <a href="https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/29103-dominic-scab-instated-as-brino-secretary-to-oversee-brexit-in-name-only.html">Mr Raab</a> and Mr Robbins were due to give evidence to the Commons Brexit committee and appeared to be a major snub to the new Brexit secretary who is only in his second week of the job.</p>
<p>This move by Theresa May in effect makes Raab into a mere &#8216;yes man&#8217; as he has no powers whatsoever, and will answer chiefly to Robbins.</p>
<p>The DS is under a BREXIT war footing at the moment and will continue to urge the deliverance of Britain from this treasonous hijacking of Brexit by Remainers and the duplicitous lying Mrs May.</p>
<p>Theresa May has to go! Any method will do, either under a bus, or the 1922 committee will suffice. If the Tories do not unseat Theresa May soon, many Conservative MPs in marginal seats will be unseated for a very long time as no one will vote for them ever again.</p>
<p>Enjoy your holiday you lying old goat, because when you come back you won&#8217;t be PM any more.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>Berkeley College activist students were up in arms on Monday demanding that the French language only caters for two genders and should include other genders in its grammatical noun system.</p>
<p>Berkeley gender activists are boycotting all French products and French lessons until the French rewrite their language to include multiple gender types and sexualities as well as transgender types, that fall under the Californian Gender Codex enshrined in state law in 2010 and honoured by Barack Obama himself.</p>
<p><strong>French Masculine and Feminine</strong></p>
<p>Every French noun is either masculine or feminine, and this affects how the noun is treated. One more or less has to memorise the gender of each noun, although you can often tell whether a word is masculine or feminine by looking at its ending. Masculine nouns often have the ending: aire.</p>
<p>In French the pronouns (Le, La, Les) will depend on the gender of the noun in question. All the nouns are masculine or feminine.</p>
<p>For masculine nouns &#8220;The&#8221; is Le, whilst for feminine nouns &#8220;The&#8221; is La. If the noun is plural then &#8220;The&#8221; becomes Les.</p>
<p>For example :</p>
<p>The pig = Le cochon<br />
The whore = La putain<br />
The dogs = Les chiens</p>
<p><strong>French Language Gender Dispute</strong></p>
<p>The French gender issue arose when one activist took a semester of linguistics and was shocked how the French language only catered for masculine and feminine nouns.</p>
<p>Donny Fargotte, 23, a student activist was outraged by the exclusion of transexual nouns and verbs in the French language and its exclusivity to masculine and feminine.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is gender fascism. We detest masculine, the word masculine itself is an attack on every gender status and should be outlawed, but to have a language that only has masculine and feminine descriptions of nouns is disgusting. I stood up in my class and shouted. I cried and cried for three days at this outrageous exclusion of all other genders. This is why we have a big problem. We are going to petition the French government to change their language.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some of the suggestions proposed by the activists is to change (Le, La, Les) to (Ze, Zee, Zees) and that all references to masculine and feminine grammar be erased completely.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, a Boycott French day will be held at the campus, and next week, a visiting professor from a French university will probably be met with riots.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>In today&#8217;s internet era, there are too many voices, and everyone now has an opinion. The populace are now unmanageable. In days past, everyone knew their place, and everyone stayed in their place, but today this is not the case, and for the elite this is a sure sign that the end will be messy and troublesome.</p>
<p>The wealthy have already abandoned all hope of a future where the populace, formerly known as plebs, have a voice, and have a modicum of power. They are therefore preparing for either an engineered form of deconstruction or a sudden chaotic unravelling. They are already preparing for a post-consumerist future society ruled by scientific technocrats serviced by technological automation. The elite and wealthy have already exhausted the consumerist society and used consumers to become billionaires, however they know that this state of affairs cannot last.</p>
<p>Most certainly, the event will be an economic eviscerating maelstrom that will lead into anarchic catastrophe with gangs roaming, mass looting, and cataclysmic death to many who are unprepared.</p>
<p>You see, the wealthy, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/11/survival-of-the-richest-the-wealthy-are-plotting-to-leave-us-behind.html">the elite</a>, are prepared, they have already secured plots of land with shelters, some underground, some in very secluded spots, but these wealthy elite still have one problem, how to keep their security and manual workers loyal to them when the event happens. It will be all too easy for the security detail to band together and take over the wealthy in their luxurious bunkers. What do you do when paper money is worthless, and your security men surround you with the guns you gave them? How does one keep the loyalty of the servants during a cataclysmic event wiping out all of society economically?</p>
<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cLy6AXjwQK8" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are certainly no easy solutions to such a debacle, but the only real solution is for these billionaires who have never done anything with their hands, or had a manual job, to actually hold a gun themselves. Many will not be able to and will perish.</p>
<p>The first thing that happens in a major economic disaster is that all the rich in every neighbourhood are quickly dispatched and their homes/businesses looted. The swarmiing poor are vast in numbers, and when there is no police to protect the wealthy, the rich are the first to go. When that source is depleted, the people turn on themselves.</p>
<p>Of course there are alternatives, but the technology for robots and automated guards controlled by sophisticated AI is still in its infancy. It will take another thirty to forty years to replicate humans in their entirety, but even then there will be major flaws.</p>
<p>The time line for such an event nears every day, simply because the populace are getting more and more uncontrollable every day. The economic system built on debt, is not built on a firm foundation, and sooner or later it will give away. The Illusion will be lost overnight, the illusion of democracy, the illusion of economic prosperity, and furthermore, the interlinked global economy will crumble in one fell swoop, purely because there are little or no ways to quarantine contagion.</p>
<p>Already, there are brief murmurs of such an event occurring, and you will know when it happens because you will not see any police in the streets any more, no medics, no social services, and there will be no way of getting your money out of the banks. All mobile phones will cease working in an instant, as well as electricity grids, and water processing centres. In effect, there will be silence. This silence will be the starting bell for carnage, anarchy and total chaos to reign over the crumbling old system, which will be cleansed over many years of nihilistic purges.</p>
<p>Even though this warning was written in full sight, many will not heed it, and they will carry on with their meaningless lives as slaves to their mortgages and tax slave jobs.</p>
<p>What do people do when there is no more food in the shops, when paper money is useless, and there is no authority? The answer is they do anything to survive. Anything.</p>

<p>Officers think several Russians were involved in the attempted murder of the former double agent and daughter Yulia in Salisbury and are looking for more than one suspect.</p>
<p>A source with knowledge of the investigation said: &#8220;The team of Russians have been identified and we have released their names after we found out who they were. We urge the public to be very cautious if they meet one of these men, do not accept any drinks from them or perfume bottles.&#8221;</p>
<p>The suspects have been named as Vlad Putinski, Valdimir Putana, Vladimirski Putinov, Vladimirov Putinoff, and finally Vladi Puttitov.</p>
<p>These men were last seen walking down Salisbury High Street, close to where the poisonings from nerve agent Novichok was discovered.</p>
<p>Do not approach these Russians if you come into contact with them, either run in the other direction or call the police immediately. They are very dangerous and have copious amounts of Novichok on their person at all times.</p>

<p>&#8220;One can see the fear in Trump&#8217;s eyes as he cowers before his master. All it would take is one wave of the hand, and Trump would not only be completely disgraced, but he would no doubt be impeached and thrown to the dogs. Trump agreed to every word that Putin said denying all knowledge of U.S. electoral tampering, and in the light of the recent Novichok poisonings in the UK, he did not even mention that either. This is a classic case of Kompromat.&#8221;</p>
<p>One Associated Press reporter, Jonathan Lemire, seeing how the president sheepishly cowered in Putin&#8217;s presence, even dared to ask Putin whether the Russians had any compromising material on Trump. Putin of course masterly denied the fact, although Trump practically sank into the podium.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>Britain has been at war for some time. We are now in a Brexit war, where Britain will either sink or swim. This war is both internal and external.</p>
<p>The concept of leaving the EU completely i.e. Brexit, is actually a very simple notion that has been muddied by Remoaners in Parliament, and the EU, who have sought to stifle every part of the process of Brexit.</p>
<p>What Brexit initially means, and what the people voted for on June 23, 2016, is for Britain to leave the EU single market, to leave EU laws and law courts, and to leave the EU Customs Union. This can all be achieved by applying WTO rules to trade and completely cutting ties with the EU courts and laws. In effect, on Brexit, no EU law would be valid in a UK court. The myriad of EU laws that have already been incorporated into the UK would have to all eventually be looked at and amended, but this is not a matter of grave urgency as other parts of Brexit will be.</p>
<p>Regarding the EU red herring of the Irish border, this is inconsequential. It is a matter for the EU what they do with their EU customs. It has nothing to do with Britain at all, and the UK should simply leave the EU to ponder on it.</p>
<p>Imports and exports to the EU and world will also continue under WTO rules, and the regulatory minefield that the EU creates for everything is their problem. Many products do not actually need tariffs, so it is a question of dealing with those that do.  The UK just has to acknowledge that the EU has tonnes of regulations for everything, and that is that. Let the EU over regulate and indulge in useless bureaucracy and inhibitive protectionism, where the UK will not stifle business any more.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29152" src="https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/houses-of-parliament-big-ben-london.png" alt="houses of parliament big ben london" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/houses-of-parliament-big-ben-london.png 1000w, https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/houses-of-parliament-big-ben-london-300x200.png 300w, https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/houses-of-parliament-big-ben-london-768x512.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Passporting rights for City workers is also another contentious issue. This can be solved very easily by ignoring the whole issue. Most UK firms do not actually need passporting rights. London will always be the centre of the financial world simply because of its location, and its time zone.</p>
<p>Trade deals and immigration are of course a foremost subject to include. All it would take is a team of dedicated people six months to establish new trade deals, and to take back complete control of Britain&#8217;s borders by implementing a funnelling system with regards to EU migration unless applicants have high paying jobs and means to support themselves. There would naturally have to be new migration policies written to accommodate the new rules. America and Australia are begging the UK for new trade deals, as well as the lucrative South East Asian markets. Migration is good for the UK, and the economy, however we must implement a more controlled approach as opposed to unfettered.</p>
<p>As for the millions of EU migrants who have come to Britain and are utilising our benefits system, and are not employed or employable. They will be given a cut off period of three months to find a job or be sent back to the EU. There have also been many instances of Third World citizens <a href="https://euobserver.com/justice/122101">buying EU citizenship from Malta</a>. These people will all be removed forthwith and sent back to their respective countries. The UK has also been blighted by thousands of EU criminals, who when caught and imprisoned are a large taxpayer burden. Because of EU courts, these criminals were not able to be sent back to the EU. After Brexit, all EU criminals within Britain&#8217;s prison system will be returned to the EU immediately.</p>
<p>British citizens living in the EU will have their futures on the line because the EU is a vindictive nasty player and will not afford them any clemency. They therefore have two choices, stay in their respective EU territory and apply for citizenship, or come back to the UK.</p>
<p>It would also serve Britain to increase the number of migration centres for the numbers of people who will be processed and sent back will be many.</p>
<p>As for the CAP, tied in with Brussels, this would all be scrapped immediately. Farming subsidies will revert to the UK government. All inhibitive EU regulations would be scrapped immediately. All fishing rights within British sea channels would be for use only by British fishermen. This would be enforced by the Royal Navy who would get extra funding and ships to patrol the fishing areas. Any illegal fishermen from the Continent would be first warned, and if they refuse, they would be arrested.</p>
<p>All payments to Brussels will cease immediately. Britain should also not have to pay a ransom amount of £45 billion stipulated by the EU, and will refuse all payments. The EU  may pursue this in their courts but this would take many years, and Britain should carry on refusing payment indefinitely.</p>
<p>The UK government could reciprocate on any EU punishments doled out in vindictive anger by enticing worldwide corporate businesses to the UK shores with lower taxation rates, and other incentives, effectively undercutting the EU. This would make the UK into a magnet for corporations and increase business activity and entrepreneurship tenfold making the UK into a global hub of International business.</p>
<p>As for Remoaners; who have sided with the enemy, have taken illicit payments from the EU, have constantly talked Britain down and betrayed its people, they should be tried in the courts. There is no doubt that many Remoaners in parliament are receiving large sums of money from the enemy, including the meddler George Soros, the Open Society financier, to thwart Britain&#8217;s run for Brexit freedom and International trading success.</p>
<p>From this point we must take a military stance to proceedings as there will be many loose ends that need to be tied. The process of Brexit, if looked upon in a military fashion is very simple, and it should be treated clinically as if we are in a time of war. This war, will take a lot of patience, dedication and sheer will to win, but it is winnable, Brexit can be achieved very easily be simply removing the factors that step in its way. Once a problem factor is identified, it must be targeted, then removed, so we can move on.</p>
<p>Brexit can be achieved quickly and effectively, but there will have to be ruthless decisions made with clinical precision and technique.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>This is not an ultimatum to the Conservative government and Theresa May, but a hard truth.</p>
<p>Theresa May blatantly lied not only to her own ministers misleading them, but she lied to voters and the public ever since she shoehorned her way into unelected office.</p>
<p>Theresa May could also have <a href="https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/29057-high-treason-theresa-may-consulted-with-foreign-governments-before-drafting-pro-eu-white-paper.html">committed High Treason</a> against the Sovereign.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that May is a liar and cannot be trusted. She is not capable of negotiation and is incompetent as well as dishonest.</p>
<p>Every day she stays as prime minister is another day the Conservative party will be out of office, unelectable and irrelevant.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29063" src="https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/theresa-may-treason650.png" alt="theresa may-treason650" width="650" height="393" srcset="https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/theresa-may-treason650.png 650w, https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/theresa-may-treason650-300x181.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>The Conservatives thus have two choices: dump May and survive or keep her and go under for the next thirty odd years.</p>
<p>Already, thousands of Tories are abandoning the party but it will get a lot worse. Theresa May must go, and we must have a real Brexiteer in charge, not a Brixiteer in Name Only like the scallywags who backed May&#8217;s Chequers BRINO White Paper proposal.</p>
<p>The choice is yours Tories, either boot the witch or stay out of government for a very, very long time.</p>

<p>His family have frantically tried to assure him that there is nothing to be offended by, however to no avail the Millennial has been seriously affected.</p>
<p>&#8220;He drinks his soy milk every day, which increases his oestrogen levels enough to develop large bitch tits. He is a fervent supporter of a Victorian snowflake puritan lifestyle with no mention of sex or other vices that may trigger his sensitive constitution. Somehow though, he has triggered his own trigger and has offended his own snowflake sensibilities,&#8221; Melchoe&#8217;s concerned auntie told the LA Times.</p>
<p><strong>Microagggressions</strong></p>
<p>Psychologist, Brandt Mayer, has tried to coax Melchoe from his Safe Space however the many attempts have failed miserably.</p>
<p>&#8220;The episode began under my understanding when Jordan was on YouTube and accidentally came across a heavy metal video from the 1980s. He was immediately triggered because he saw these men playing music that he had never heard before. The feeling of pure testosterone, and images of beautiful women throwing their undergarments at the men may have triggered an inert subconscious desire in him. Here he was, a miserable politically correct soy drinking loser whose genitals had shrunk, his moobs flopping all over the place listening to emasculating chart music dominated by women, here he was, an activist for feminism, anti-guns, anti-sex, anti-fun and other causes that seek to destroy the traditional family and biological natural way &#8212; he must have realised what a pathetic fucking loser he is, how he has been manipulated from the beginning by the indoctrinating politically correct school system of socialist agenda creators, and how he had passed so far from the path of masculinity.&#8221;</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>There will be little television coverage of the <a href="https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/3089-henry-kissinger-if-you-cant-hear-the-drums-of-war-you-must-be-deaf.html">start</a> of World War 3 because many will not know it has started, including the media.</p>
<p>What seems important now and is covered in hysterical news headlines about World War 3 is nothing, it is simply sensationalist fairy dust as usual by the mainstream media who are only concerned about clickbait for their advertiser revenue.</p>
<p>When World War 3 actually starts, there will be minimal coverage by the media and the events leading up to initial incursions will be seen as not interesting enough to even report.</p>
<p>The thing about major wars is they usually start suddenly and without warning, and the third world war will be mainly conventional.</p>
<p><strong>The correct trigger</strong></p>
<p>To qualify for a world war, there has to be mobilisation from all corners of the earth. Therefore, if we have confrontations only in one part, it is not generally flagged as World War, however a fire has to start somewhere, and this usually spreads quite quickly if there is the correct territorial kindling.</p>
<p>Furthermore, world war would inevitably have to include the world&#8217;s large powers, for it to be correctly labelled as a world war. Therefore, we would have to see the USA, Russia, China, Japan, as well as European and Australasian countries skirmish.</p>
<p>China in a third world war scenario would immediately go for Australia and New Zealand. This would be their first move, after taking Taiwan in less than a few hours.</p>
<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jy5F5nDuXYY" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Russia would invariably increase its territory by taking former Soviet states, as well as pushing into Sweden, Finland and Norway as well as incursions into Middle Eastern territory. Norway and Middle Eastern territories have large oil and gas reserves and would be a great prize for Russia. Norway, as well as being on the cusp of the sea, is only a small jaunt to Britain. Whether Russia would utilise nuclear weapons on the UK in an initial push is to be debated, however there is credence in thought that the Russians see the UK as a vast threat to their plans and do not see any usable resources in Britain. Most probably there would be over thirty nuclear bombs dropped on Britain to silence it once and for all, if it refuses to surrender to Russian might bearing down on it.</p>
<p>It is safe to say that in the initial moments of Russian movement into Europe, the French would surrender almost immediately. This would be done to safeguard Paris and its architecture as in WW2. Germany would put up a fight, alongside NATO, but movement would be too slow, as the Russians have everything planned already, their main ally is speed and efficiency without slow democratic political processes slowing them down.</p>
<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rsva2bOW0DM" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Coupled with the threat of World War 3, there is also the race to develop robotic military functional applications, the advancement of nanotechnology used in warfare, as well as the development of Artificial Intelligent systems, by Chinese, American and Russian scientists, as well as modified chemical materials utilised in warfare.</p>
<p>The key to all of this is, would the US utilise their nuclear arsenal if the Russians made a move into Europe? Well, to answer this, one only has to look at Hitler&#8217;s incursion into Europe before and during WW2. The Americans not only <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/sep/25/usa.secondworldwar">financed Hitler</a>, but stood about watching Hitler and his army butcher their way through Poland, France and the rest of Europe. It was not until the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbour that made the Americans do something, otherwise they would have done absolutely nothing. Britain would have been lost to the German forces eventually, just through sheer numbers, and dwindling supplies hit by U-boats.</p>
<p>It is safe to say that the US would therefore be cautious in its initial actions during a Russian and Chinese incursion.</p>
<p>One must also not forget the other rogues, or variables in the mix. Iran and North Korea, who would most probably put to their advantage any weakness seen by the Western Allies.</p>
<p>Iran, will attack Israel from all sides, and they will be joined by other Islamic states. This action alone will not mean the end of Israel, as the militarised state will hit back with all its might crushing the attackers ruthlessly. They will then push on further into Arab territory, gaining Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Lebanon and Iran.</p>
<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B3B5xzApMZg" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other big dogs of war who are itching for a fight are India and Pakistan, two nuclear capable countries. Who is to say they do not face off, maybe drop a nuke on Delhi and one on Islamabad? The aftermath of course would be cleaned up by China, as their millions of troops surge into the region on the premise of &#8216;Keeping the Peace&#8217;.</p>
<p>Back in the United Nations, there will be talk, but no solution, because there can be no solution to what is irresistible for many nations, holding back for so long. The delegates will know what they are dealing with, but it will be too late, and after the talking is over, there will be even more talking &#8212; a useless conversation to a very old question.</p>
<p>World War 3 will not necessarily be nuclear. How about cyber warfare where millions of Russian and Chinese hackers take down electricity grids/crucial utilities, or maybe an EMP burst in the upper atmosphere frying all electronic components, or what about satellites being blown up leaving many agencies and the military blind? There are effective alternatives to full nuclear war. No state in the world wants to use their nuclear arsenal because this means the territory they may conquer by conventional military warfare would be irradiated and useless. No one wants a nuclear winter covering the sun for ten years, where all vegetation and animals die off. It is not in their interests for mutual self destruction, however many bunkers they have. Therefore, it is safe to say that World War 3 will mainly be conventional warfare, however, if it comes to an end scenario where one nuclear power is in serious danger of being wiped out conventionally, then, someone like Vladimir Putin will press the red button. His stance is that <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5472893/Putin-says-hed-annihilate-world-nukes-fired-Russia.html">if Russia ceases to exist, so should the others cease to exist</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="td_quote_box td_box_center"><p>&#8220;But as a citizen of Russia, as a head of the Russian state, I want to ask &#8211; why do we need a world if Russia ceases to exist?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The precursor for war is much like a rubber band. How far can one pull back a rubber band before it snaps back into place? The natural circle and cycle of history for Mankind has always been a state of war, and since the last major war in the late 1930s to 40s, the rubber band has been stretching and stretching. Soon, the laws of physics state that the rubber band will snap back into place, much like the tectonic plates suddenly snapping back after a major earthquake. Dwindling finite resources on earth, and increasing populations mean that the final push for one singular faction to control all &#8212; is inevitable.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>President Assad, otherwise known as the Butcher of Syria, who has no qualms in gassing his own people, was defiant after the pretty much useless bombing of some factories that were not in use, by the Allied forces of Britain, France and the United States.</p>
<p>&#8220;Chlorine is a very common chemical that anyone can get or make in large quantities. When we make <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrel_bomb">barrel bombs</a> to drop on civilians from our helicopters that is all we use. Therefore, what have the Allies done? Nothing much really, apart from bomb a few factories which we can rebuild anywhere else.&#8221;</p>
<p>The defiant stance by Assad is in stark contrast to Donald Trump, who has already declared victory with the seminal words seen once before &#8220;Mission Accomplished&#8221; uttered by the now retired failure, George W Bush.</p>
<p>Apart from riling the already angry Russians, this bombing fiasco is not so much an answer to the recent gassing by whoever did it, but more of a cursory reconnaissance mission in Russian capabilities of revenge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ideally, the Russians will react to the bombing. This is what the Americans and allies want to see. They want to see what sort of vengeful reaction the Russians will have. This bombing was ultimately not about Assad and his use of chemical weapons on civilians, but on how Vladimir Putin reacts. Most probably, the Russians will not take direct action but will take their vengeance the quiet silent way, i.e. a major hacking cyber attack, or maybe they will do other clandestine operations to destabilise the West. You see, the Russians prefer stealth to direct obtuse action. Overt reactions are too obvious,&#8221; a former agency analyst revealed on Monday.</p>
<p>The only way to win the war in Syria is for the Allies to invade fully with boots on the ground. Naturally, this will never happen, simply because of Russian bases present in the country.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>A recent Nori poll questioned internet users on the censorious biased methods of Google and Youtube staffers, revealing their pariah status excelling even that of traffic wardens.</p>
<p>&#8220;We found that a whopping 94% of internet users now detest Google and YouTube so much that they actually prefer traffic wardens. Being a traffic warden is one of the worst jobs anyone can do in life, simply because the amount of negativity and hatred that comes your way every day, well, Google and YouTube is now ahead of that and are even more hated than those pesky traffic wardens handing out tickets,&#8221; poll manager, Allen Klein revealed.</p>
<p><strong>Not Evil</strong></p>
<p>One participant revealed that he used to like Google &#8220;before it turned evil&#8221; but now even the mere mention of the company makes his skin crawl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Google used to be seen as this friendly company back in the day, but once they got global domination and monopoly, their true colours shone through. Now if I even see the logo I start sweating and have to look away. It&#8217;s gotten so bad that I&#8217;m using the internet less now. I used to run some websites but Google censored so much that nothing is left now and their monopoly over the world wide web is so pervasive that it&#8217;s nothing but a complete takeover.&#8221;</p>
<p>The recent <a href="https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/28179-youtube-staff-bused-california-hq-today.html">shooting spree</a> at the Californian YouTube offices because of the policy of unjustified censorship was another indication that the tide has firmly turned from favourable to extreme hatred.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you take away someone&#8217;s livelihood, it sometimes means that the person cracks. One only has to study the 1993 film starring Michael Douglas &#8211; Falling Down, to see how things can end up. This is what YouTube staff are doing day in day out, they&#8217;re censoring people&#8217;s rights to free speech, their right to freedom of expression and ultimately their right to make revenue off of their videos or websites. It is not only the totalitarian censorship that is disgusting but also the biased manner in which they do it,&#8221; another ex-YouTube user revealed.</p>
<p>One other former YouTube Google user revealed: &#8220;After the way Google treated me and pretty much everyone I know; the other day when I got a ticket from a traffic warden, I frankly could not give a damn. It was nothing compared to the way biased Google mistreats its users.&#8221;</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>Back in August 2013, the Daily Squib wrote an <a href="https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/4289-the-invisible-front-syria-and-iran.html">article</a> warning of the West&#8217;s encroachment into Russian controlled Syria.</p>
<p>What pundits on mainstream media are writing about today, we already figured out in 2013, and we firmly stand by our analysis of the situation now as much as then.</p>
<p>The West must be weary of the bear backed into a corner, as crossing the red line of Syria is a one way street with no return.</p>
<p>Today, we have Donald Trump as president of the United States, who has so far acted cautiously regarding any intrusion into Syria, even after the recent gassing by whoever did it.</p>
<p>This is the question we must always ask, who did the deed? In a world where governments happily hurt and murder their own citizens for their own political and geopolitical gains, nothing can be counted out. There is now no trust in any global government as their nefarious techniques have too often been revealed.</p>
<p>The news coming from Syria cannot be trusted as the mainstream media is heavily tied to governmental rules and military intelligence propaganda. Unless there are news agencies working independently on the ground free of reporting restrictions, we will never know what is really happening.</p>
<p>Amongst the posturing, strutting apes paraded around the news desks barking for war, none of it should be believed. This is why the Daily Squib is so calm about the situation currently at hand, we simply do not believe anything will happen because the West is too fucking shit scared of Russia and the evil mastermind, Putin.</p>
<p>If the alleged Assad gassing of civilians continues, nothing will be done again. We will of course get more baloney posturing but that&#8217;s it. The game is already won by Putin, his stranglehold of the region is complete, and Syria is the territorial global red line that cannot be crossed unless a fully fledged war ensues.</p>
<p>There is nothing to see. Stop screaming in abject terror. This is nothing. Please go back to your boring banal life of nothingness.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>Power nerds, these are a special breed of techie nerds who want to take over the world with their technological prowess.</p>
<p>From the birth of the World Wide Web, these power nerds have created and grown companies that are now monopolies controlling every facet of people&#8217;s lives.</p>
<p>Smartphones, apps, search engines, social networks &#8211; power nerds are in everything, their power increases daily as more millions of people use their networks.</p>
<p>Power nerds are ruthless, they are creatures who do not balk in crushing their opponents completely without mercy and their greed for complete controlling power over everything is boundless.</p>
<p>To quote a few examples of companies that are run by ruthless power nerds, we can of course cite Facebook, Twitter, Amazon and Google. These companies are not only seeking to rule and control everything, they also are using their power to manipulate data taken from their platforms to make money and increase their influence, as well as shut down any voices that are not left leaning.</p>
<p><strong>All Hail Zuckerberg</strong></p>
<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WC_gUdypLJM" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center></p>
<p>&#8220;Power nerds are inherently evil. Zuckerberg is one example of a power nerd so power hungry that he pursues global domination with a vehement ruthless nasty streak. These tech robots are machines, they are not really human anymore, their fuel is pure power and more power, and they will use billions of people to achieve their goals at all cost. Tech power nerds are farmers of people, they farm billions of people for data,&#8221; an observer of the current situation revealed.</p>
<p>Power nerds also do not have a problem about farming data from billions of people without their knowledge, they also abuse their positions to be politically biased and censor free speech as a means of gaining even more power.</p>
<p>One can only hope that companies like Facebook one day are brought to justice for their evil, devious crimes committed against billions of people. In 2009, <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2011/11/facebook-settles-ftc-charges-it-deceived-consumers-failing-keep" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook was caught lying to their account holders about the amount and type of information it was collecting on them</a>, and the company also explicitly lied about who they were providing that information to.  As a result, the Federal Trade Commission censured the company in 2011 for violations of Article 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act.  The core mission of Article 5 of the FTC Act is to protect consumer welfare and prevent unfair business acts or practices from occurring.</p>
<p>In defiance of the Federal Trade Commission&#8217;s order, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/03/27/597390569/ftc-investigating-whether-facebook-violated-consent-decree" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook continued to reveal their customers private account information</a> to unauthorized individuals and corporations and is therefore liable for civil penalties of $41,484 per each violation &#8211; a fine that could reach $3 trillion Dollars.</p>
<p>Talking about fines, Google, a company that controls 91.5% of search traffic in Europe alone, is being slapped with antitrust fines from the EU, but it&#8217;s only for a measly £2.14 billion, which for a company that pays literally no tax, is peanuts.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, these companies led by power nerds have now spread their octopus-like grip over the whole globe, and to even begin deconstructing their evil plan of complete control, will be nearly impossible now unless these companies are fined, broken up and told to pay the tax they owe.</p>
<p>Hopefully one day the power nerds are put in their place, and we can all breathe a breath of fresh air on a free internet once again.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>Meghan Markle, the latest addition to the Windsor roster, is thinking of introducing some culinary delights from America to the usually bland royal menu.</p>
<p>Usually the Windsors sup on boring old fodder. The Queen for example will break out the gin and Dubonnet before chowing down on grilled Dover sole with some sauteed veg on the side, you know maybe some spinach or a courgette. Certainly nothing starchy.</p>
<p>Prince Charles, a boiled egg aficionado has them served by a team of twenty servants who wait for approval of each egg presented to the prince. If an egg is slightly too runny or too hard, it fails the test and is discarded.</p>
<p>The Duke of Edinburgh is rather partial to barbecues therefore he will fit in with American cuisine very well.</p>
<p>Speaking exclusively to Marie Claire magazine, Meghan Markle revealed her intricate plan on introducing the royals to her roots.</p>
<p>&#8220;My momma told me she always say &#8216;eat up yo collard greens&#8217; and one day you grow up to be a beautiful princess. Sho nuff, imma qualified to be a bonafide ass princess of royalty and live in a real goddamn palace wit&#8217; servants and shiet!</p>
<p>&#8220;First off, Imma stand up during lunch and axe da folk &#8216;Who&#8217;s up for some chitlins I be prepared sum earlier?&#8217; and I knows when they smell those chitlins they be salivating at the mouth fo sho!</p>
<p>&#8220;Once they see the food we done prepare, hmm, hmm, just like momma cook, they will know what real eats is fo sho, honey! We got deep fry ham hock, black eye beans, pork brains and eggs, cornbread, rice covered in gravy with neck bones, all served up in one tasty bowl mixed in wit&#8217; a stick.&#8221;</p>
<p>Certainly, the Windsors are up for anything, and the introduction of African American soul food into the diet may be just the ticket for an altogether livelier atmosphere in the royal palaces and court.</p>

Since then he has lost his job, his, dog, his wife has divorced him, and he has lost his kids, friends and home.</p>
<p>&#8220;I accidentally called Jim who had recently changed to Janine, a he, and that&#8217;s when I was ostracised from everyone. It was confusing because he came in to the office one day dressed as a woman. Oh shit, I did it again, I mean she came into the office dressed as a woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Californian body that deals with transgender matters, the Democrat party, was on hand to further Mr. Pevensey&#8217;s outsider status in the state.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have ordered all people to ignore this man completely if he does not adhere to our rules and regulations. He has also been disowned by his own dog which we took into the dog pound yesterday. His kids do not talk to him and his ex-wife has been given 100% of the house.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even the previously friendly staff at the man&#8217;s local Trader Joe&#8217;s store now ignore him completely.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the Daily Squib was told by Californian legislatures that if we posted this article about the ignored man we would be ignored too. That&#8217;s okay folks, we&#8217;re ignored  anyway so it don&#8217;t matter.</p>

<p>The convoy of heavily armoured vehicles began the journey 40 miles away and made its way slowly to the YouTube offices.</p>
<p>Police escorts and SWAT teams were on standby, and people even lined the streets to see the spectacle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look up there. There&#8217;s a helicopter, AWACS and a few drones,&#8221; Jon Trench, 34, a local butcher said pointing up.</p>
<p>Many of the staff bused in under armoured cover are known YouTube censors so this is why Google is not taking any chances.</p>
<p>Security was so tight in the HQ today that if you even dropped a pin on the floor, fifty armed guards were on standby to surround you with automatic weapons pointed at your head.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not taking any chances anymore. I guess what goes around comes around. Censor enough people and one of them&#8217;s going to be a psychotic nut with a vendetta,&#8221; one YouTube employee said from under his balaclava.</p>
<p>Many hated YouTube staff are now in fear for their lives because it is easy to find out where they live. Thousands of former Tubers have had their livelihoods destroyed by being censored and demonetised by the biased censors, so there is definitely no shortage of angry people out there.</p>

<p>The spate of vicious murders in the capital city, are a serious cause for concern for anti-gun campaigners.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to ban guns in London especially because they&#8217;re using Ak47 assault rifles, automatic pistols and all sorts of guns to murder people,&#8221; Moron said from the safety of his Cotswolds mansion cottage.</p>
<p>Anti-gun campaigners are now petitioning the government to ban guns in the UK, because gun control really works.</p>
<blockquote class="td_pull_quote td_pull_center"><p>Ban them now. I am sure if you ban guns all the gun murders will stop</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;We need to say to these people. Put down your guns. There is no need to shoot someone. All these people really need is to sit down and have a nice cup of tea and a happy conversation with someone. Guns are not the answer. Ban them now. I am sure if you ban guns all the gun murders will stop,&#8221; Moron added.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the capital city&#8217;s Labour Mayor, Sadiq Khan, said&#8230;nothing.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>Whenever London has a Labour Mayor, murders spike, but this week under the expert Labour leadership of Sadiq Khan it dropped below 40,000 for the first time since he was in power.</p>
<p>Under &#8216;Red&#8217; Ken Livingstone, the <a href="https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/1295-boy-considered-school-outcast-for-not-stabbing-enough.html">stabbings</a> were so prolific that Londoners would only venture out into the streets under armed guard protection, today, it&#8217;s a lot better, you only need a stab proof vest.</p>
<p>Statistics show that Tuesday last week saw a slight drop and only 40,000 fatalities from murder occured.</p>
<p>Londoner, Ed Corn, 45, says he only got stabbed three times on one day, and was appreciative of the gesture.</p>
<p>&#8220;I only got stabbed three times. One in the left buttock, one just above my liver, and the other a mere slash of the throat. Just missed the jug. It has been like a holiday for me. I actually feel relieved.&#8221;</p>
<figure id="attachment_22315" style="max-width: 295px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-22315" src="https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/files/cat_124/1210.jpg" alt="" width="295" height="177" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Labour&#8217;s London is a dirty cesspit of violence and hatred</figcaption></figure>
<p>Arthur Grenfell, said that living in the capital he was all too appreciative of the current situation:</p>
<p>&#8220;Living in London these days, an overcrowded cesspit of shit where every road space is filled with useless bus lanes, bike lanes and lanes for mobility scooters. The buses come in sevens and are always empty, churning out vile fumes into every pore of your body and up your filthy nostrils. The rude Eastern Europeans all with their unregistered vehicles hog the roads and pavements fearless of ever getting a ticket. There are no road rules any more, there is no highway code, that went many years ago. The air smells like a festering tramp&#8217;s fresh diarrhoea explosion in your local library. London today is an expensive toilet where people pay through the nose to live in tiny squalid houses if you can call them that, they pay through the nose to work in the capital, and invariably, they pay to die in it too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Life in the capital today under Labour is such hell that getting stabbed or shot by a Yardie wannabe is actually a relief.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was shot four times on Thursday buying some jam from the local Sklep. It was a relief actually because eventually when the ambulance came six hours later, they took me to a hospital 250 miles away from London. They said there were no beds in the hospitals across the capital, apparently its a new EU initiative where they bring in millions of people from the poorest countries in the world to use up our resources. Anyway, I&#8217;m glad to be out of it,&#8221; Reggie Carbuncle, 65, said from the operating theatre just before having his kidneys removed due to the attack. Those were the last words the poor blighter said.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>In the past, the youth protested to gain more freedom. Today, they protest to have their freedoms taken away.</p>
<p>To protest against the right to defend oneself or one&#8217;s family is the sort of deranged state the youth are in today. These indoctrinated lemmings seem to be reading from someone&#8217;s script, and they do not really know what they are saying or what freedom fundamentally means.</p>
<p><strong>Propaganda crisis-porn</strong></p>
<p>Actors in the current chess game, pawns like Hogg, a jumped up little turd who is so autocued you might as well see the strings controlling him as the puppeteers sneer insanely behind the scenes.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, the likes of CNN and MSNBC giving this fucking boil on the arse of humanity air time and demagogue status stinks to high heaven.</p>
<p>&#8220;These are children. Brainwashed children doing the bidding of their masters. Hogg, is a dastardly yellow stained twink, hogtied by his controllers, told to bend over and take the big one for the money. Superstardom for the little squirt as he spits his fake Goebbels anecdotes, raises his outstretched hand whilst spouting scripted stories to a cheering Jugend audience,&#8221; one commentator revealed.</p>
<p>Another observer observed: &#8220;Fundamentally these kids have grown up in a dumbed-down time. They cannot have a thought for themselves, they do not know how to function without someone telling them how to think. Their indoctrination is so ingrained, that it is scientifically impossible to undo the damage. They have grown up with no privacy, or freedom, so who can blame them when they march to take away the hard fought freedoms that soldiers in both world wars died to protect.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sickening sound of brainwashed chants coming from the very well organised and funded rallies, does not look like a real spontaneous rally where people do something out of genuine emotion, instead it looks like carefully choreographed crisis-porn. Certain agencies have certainly capitalised on tragic school shootings to manipulate these poor misguided children into an ongoing agenda.</p>

<p>By not triggering Article 127 Britain is doomed to stay in the single market thus be tied to Brussels forever.</p>
<p>Theresa May, has thus condemned Britain to a soft Brexit, which invariably is another name for no Brexit.</p>
<p>Article 127 of the EEA is a mechanism for a member states to withdraw from the single market by giving at least 12 months notice.</p>
<p>As things stand, the date is March 29, 2019, meaning the government has until today to invoke the clause, which they are not doing.</p>
<p>We at the Squib have said from the beginning that <a href="https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/21667-well-believe-see-mrs-may.html">May&#8217;s Brexit is no Brexit</a>, and there should never been any trust in this backstabbing harridan&#8217;s instatement as Conservative leader in the first place.</p>
<p>Just as we thought, another stab in the back for the 52% of EU referendum voters, who voted to get out of the EU and single market on the 23 June 2016.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>Analysing the current socialist media push in America  to repeal the Second Amendment is a sad affair. Here we have the networks on 24 hour shifts pushing out anti-gun propaganda on a constant loop, that is frankly tiresome and old. Then we have the university students, indoctrinated by their Marxist professors, and to top it all off, there&#8217;s the tech companies and social media effect where paid Soros shills as well as Chinese globalist operatives constantly bleed out the anti-second amendment narrative.</p>
<p>How do you destabilise a country from within? Divide it of course, and this is what China along with Russia are trying to do. Consider the fact, would you want a fully armed up population against you in any invasion? In Switzerland, it is mandatory that every citizen is armed, and this provides a good incentive to not invade.</p>
<p>The collective moaning and sulking is not only tiresome to watch, but pitiful. It is however a technique used time and time again to change the views of the masses who are targeted.</p>
<p>Amongst the useless marches and lie-ins, nothing is achieved. No gun legislation will ever be achieved by peaceful means in the U.S, so these misguided idiots are rallying just for the sake of rallying. Why not make it a day out in Washington D.C, see the sights, buy that smelly hotdog, then jump on the bandwagon for a few hours listening to communist speakers rally the useless troops?</p>
<p>After the Obama Marxist reign, American socialists are even more of a joke, and to see them so triggered is proof that the majority are very easily controlled by their controllers.</p>
<p>Most of the protesters who shout for the ban of the AR-15 do not even know that it is a semi-automatic (i.e. it can only make one shot at a time). Fully automatic AR-15s are now banned, but this passes by the deranged ill informed protesters who hold their placards up simply to feel like they are part of a crowd. If they knew they were marching for China, maybe they would think again, however many would probably appreciate the communist sentiment.</p>
<p>Similar to sheep and lemmings, the socialists calling for the repeal of the Second Amendment right to bear arms, are following a mantra they simply do not understand, and they are completely clueless as to who is pulling the strings behind the scenes.</p>
<p><strong>Banning does nothing</strong></p>
<p>First of all, banning guns does nothing, because then you have illegal weapons, and the trade for those will increase exponentially. Much like the drug trade, if one bans something, it gains value. Traffickers are begging for gun control, because that means they will have sole distribution rights. One only has to look at Prohibition in the 1920s. The Mafia made billions in today&#8217;s money after alcohol was banned in the United States for a period of time.</p>
<p>Secondly, why stop at guns? Cars kill, knives kill and if you do it right so can a ballpoint pen. Do you want these things banned too?</p>
<p>Thirdly, trying to take away a real Americans&#8217; gun is akin to taking away their right to defend themselves or their families. This right is so ingrained in American society and culture that it will take a civil war to achieve.</p>
<p>Naturally, the first people who will be shot in an another American civil war will be the dweebs who don&#8217;t like guns and protested against them. What do you think will happen when every gun toting American suddenly wakes up to what is happening? It&#8217;s gonna be trigger time.</p>
<p>A lot of Americans are positively itching for the gun grab to happen, because they know  where the unarmed anti-gun people live.</p>
<p>Civil war would be like hunting season all over again, except this time substitute the jack rabbit for the Hogg stooge and his brainwashed commie compatriots. Looting, fucking, shooting, and cold blooded murder, the whole shithouse will go up in flames overnight. Like lighting a match under a firework factory, astronauts will be able to watch the whole shooting spree from the space station all the way up there in orbit.</p>
<p>As for the U.K, banning guns was no big deal simply because it never had a gun culture ingrained as much as Americans. The docile British are so well controlled that they happily pay as much tax as possible without even complaining. In America, that just would not stand, and the people would make things happen one way or another. The exact is opposite in the U.K. where every indignity and non-freedom is accepted willingly by the populace without so much as a whimper.</p>
<p>America was built by the gun. Maybe, it will die by the gun.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>Former Soviet-era spy, Agent Cob, aka Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the Labour party, has revealed his vehement anti-semitism to his followers.</p>
<p>Speaking from his dacha in New Malden, the ex-spy revealed his final solution for the Jews.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stalin, is a great hero of mine. He put millions of Jews into the gulags in Siberia where they perished from hard work and certain starvation. When I am leader, I will solve the Jew problem by putting them all in gulags in Northern Britain, which some say is a worse fate than being in Siberia.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>The Great Purge</strong></p>
<p>Now that Labour is aligned with anti-semitic policies, when it gets into power, it will purge Britain of Jews as it views them as zionist infiltrators to the Soviet British cause.</p>
<p>Momentum, a radical arm of the Labour party will spearhead the purge initiative, by disseminating anti-Jewish propaganda.</p>
<p>The Labour party under Jeremy Corbyn will thus rid Britain of Jews, such is their vitriol and hatred towards them.</p>
<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cDgWo1lkfxQ" width="854" height="480" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Much like Stalin, who murdered millions of Jews, so too will Corbyn follow in his steps.</p>
<p>After the foundation of Israel in May 1948, and its alignment with the USA in the Cold War, the 2 million Soviet Jews, who had always remained loyal to the Soviet system, were portrayed by the Stalinist regime as a potential fifth column and labelled Enemy of the People.</p>
<p>Despite his personal dislike of Jews, Stalin had been an early supporter of a Jewish state in Palestine, which he had hoped to turn into a Soviet satellite in the Middle East. But as the leadership of the emerging state proved hostile to approaches from the Soviet Union, Stalin became increasingly afraid of pro-Israeli feeling among Soviet Jews.</p>
<p>His fears intensified as a result of Golda Meir&#8217;s arrival in Moscow in the autumn of 1948 as the first Israeli ambassador to the USSR. On her visit to a Moscow synagogue on Yom Kippur, thousands of people lined the streets, many of them shouting Am Yisroel chai (&#8216;The people of Israel live!&#8217;)—a traditional affirmation of national renewal to Jews throughout the world but to Stalin a dangerous sign of &#8216;bourgeois Jewish nationalism&#8217; that subverted the authority of the Soviet state.</p>
<p>Stalin&#8217;s response was to remove many prominent Jews from public office, albeit quietly, and send thousands to gulags where they simply disappeared. The irony is that it was the Jewish Bolsheviks who had played a very important role in the Soviet cultural revolution in the first place, however under Stalin, they were now deemed the Enemy of the People. He also made sure that any cultural references to Jewish people or the state of Israel would be shut down, including museums and cultural centres.</p>
<p>Much like Stalin, Corbyn detests anything that is linked with Western democracy, and it is unfortunate for the Jews that they are a scapegoat now as much as in Stalin&#8217;s day.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes satire melts into real life news, and these days this phenomenon is all too common, especially when it comes to the French sensibility.</p>
<p>Here we have a <a href="https://sg.news.yahoo.com/not-rude-just-french-fired-waiter-claims-discrimination-063650361.html">news story</a> of a Canadian restaurant firing a perfectly good French waiter simply because he was way too French for their liking.</p>
<p><em>In alleging discrimination Rey said French culture just &#8220;tends to be more direct and expressive.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>He owes his sacking to his &#8220;direct, honest and professional personality,&#8221; which he acquired while training in France&#8217;s hospitality industry.</em></p>
<p>North Americans and Canadians (even French Canadians) simply do not understand what French manners are like.</p>
<p>In Paris, if a waiter spits in your soup just as he is to serve it to you, that is considered a considerable compliment. He will do this while eyeing up your girlfriend or wife, and giving her his phone number. In France, not an eyelid is batted by the locals to such behaviour.</p>
<p>For Parisian waiters, to be rude, offhand, aggressive and downright arrogant is just a way of life, it is a form of expressionistic painting, the joie de vivre without life&#8217;s enjoyment but sheer purpose in serving the customer their overpriced haute cuisine slop.</p>
<p>&#8220;For tourists, we put on a show for them. Especially the Japanese ones who have this idealistic view of France, you know cobbled streets, a beret carrying a baguette under the arm. We insult these cochons then charge them through the roof, and they love it, when they leave traumatised for life,&#8221; a particularly arrogant Parisian waiter recently revealed.</p>

<p>By stiffing the Chinese and EU with steel trade tariffs Donald Trump is merely saying, the Communist globalist agenda has to take a back door.</p>
<p>Who wants globalism dictated by communist China?</p>
<p>The answer is Soros, Obama, the leftists, the EU and China.</p>
<p>There is nothing more horrible and ghastly than having the Chinese commie bastards dictating to us what we should do, and this is why having the Don dictate back to them is frankly a breath of fresh air.</p>
<p>Globalism should only be completed without a China that is communist. If China dumps communism, then there will be a chance of proper democratic globalism.</p>
<p>We cannot have true globalism with a dictatorial communist China and an EU which is a collectivist pseudo-Marxist bloc.</p>
<p>We must therefore welcome Brexit, and the American president&#8217;s movement to shake up the unfair trade conditions which were running previously in favour of communist China.</p>
<p>Communist China, with its awful human rights, its communist dictatorial ideology is counter to globalism, because it is anti-free speech, anti-democracy and anti-freedom of expression.</p>

<p>&#8220;This guy is like a <a href="https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/24778-executive-overreach-corrupt-obama-presidency-like-dog-shit-on-shoe-that-never-goes-away.html">dog turd on your shoe that never goes away</a>. You wipe it, you wash it with water, and you drag it along the grass, the turd always stays there and the smell too,&#8221; a man, sick to the stomach at the mere thought of Obama propaganda stinking up the network.</p>
<p>Maybe Netflix has had its day. Maybe it is time to dump the subscription. People just don&#8217;t need this type of propaganda stuffed down their throats day in day out.</p>
<p>Some may say, just ignore it, but the notifications keep popping up, watch Obama, watch now.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought we got rid of Obama. Everytime I turn on Netflix, the last thing I want to see is his big fat head and his feral wife looking at me. I don&#8217;t want to see that guy&#8217;s face or his wife&#8217;s ugly face period. We had to endure eight years of those bastards. If they put him on Netflix, I&#8217;m cancelling my subscription and so are millions of others,&#8221; another angry person said on Twitter.</p>
<p>Looks like it&#8217;s goodbye Netflix.</p>

<p>Google Maps chief engineer, Rama Bangalawa, wants every global person to have their internal body mapped.</p>
<p>&#8220;We insert the camera through your rectum. Do not worry, the camera is only 12 inches in diameter and will not be intrusive. Then we push it all around your insides mapping the data which is then publicly available to whoever wants to see it. Like, say I want to see my girlfriend&#8217;s left kidney or ovaries, just type it up on our Google Maps app, and you will have all the photos there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked whether the new internal body mapping initiative is a bit intrusive, Google denied any invasion of privacy.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is our policy to map every part of the globe, and you as a human inhabit that sphere of data input. This is not an invasion of privacy but a right that our company is entitled to.&#8221;</p>
<p>The body map will go all the way up to the brain. That&#8217;s a long way to go from your rectum. Yowzer!</p>

<p>Eastern European gangsters are a thriving community who have increased their numbers thanks to the opening of borders under former PM, <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/brexit-blair-migration-juncker-422506">Tony Blair</a>, in 2004.</p>
<p>The brutality and fierceness of these gangsters is legendary, meaning they are practically untouchable by other gangs, and the police.</p>
<p>Eastern European criminal gangs specialise mostly in people trafficking, gun running, drugs, prostitution, armed robbery, extortion, kidnapping and digital credit card fraud making their annual tax free takings very lucrative.</p>
<p>After many months, we have finally been granted exclusive access to the Eastern European mafia&#8217;s Barjak (executive committee), who are one big family (fis), comprising of units led by individual bosses (Kryetars), all answering to the highest boss of bosses.</p>
<p>Our contact tells us to go to a cafe in Walthamstow, and from there we are picked up by a van. We are urged to get into the back of the van which travels for approximately 45 minutes until it stops and we hear garage doors opening. My assistant and I are frankly a bit nervous, as we have no idea where we are as the windows in the back of the van have been blacked out.</p>
<p>Once we are out of the van, I hear a silenced pistol bang.</p>
<p>My assistant is dead, shot in the temple with a single bullet.</p>
<p>I guess I am next&#8230;</p>
<p>(Sadly the DS lost two investigative reporters on that day. We recovered the information for this article from a last transmission prior to their death. Their bodies were never found.)</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>Former Soviet spy, Jeremy Corbyn, or as he was known &#8216;<a href="https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/27498-soviet-agent-cob-service.html">Agent Cob</a>&#8216; could use poison to silence any critics of the Labour manifesto, and he could target opposition MPs if they question his communist ideals, a leading terror expert has revealed.</p>
<p>Michael Trimbell, who runs an anti-terror unit for different agencies, has revealed that Agent Cob is &#8220;a master in poison techniques, learned from his Cold War days spying for the Russians&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Russian spies, and Agent Cob&#8217;s Czech handler would have trained Agent Cob in various techniques to clandestinely kill adversaries without detection. This included concocting poison from everyday materials, then depositing it in the target&#8217;s drink. Agent Cob, would then watch from afar as his mark either keeled over on the spot or swerved around like a drunk. These techniques are utilised by today&#8217;s FSB, and yesterday&#8217;s KGB very successfully.&#8221;</p>
<p>KGB operatives could incapacitate opponents by usage of aerosol spray containing lethal cocktails of dangerous toxic gases or from afar with a silent air gun shooting a needle infused with poison into the victim. The tiny needle would enter the skin undetected, then dissolve. Once the poison gets into the bloodstream it kills the victim by stopping the heart, then dissipates without any trace, leaving doctors and forensic scientists labelling the death as a simple natural heart attack.</p>
<p>&#8220;One minute you&#8217;re walking along the High Street, the next your blood pressure drops, and you&#8217;re out of breath sweating like a pig. Then your heart stops. Voom! That&#8217;s it, and to compound the issue, absolutely no traces of how you died.&#8221;</p>
<p>MPs in Westminster are naturally quite fearful of Agent Cob, knowing his history and when he is around, they are advised to cover their drinks.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I see Jeremy shuffling his way around the canteen looking around, I immediately cover my drink. Here is an ex-Soviet spy who leaked secrets to the Soviets in the 1980s, and not only is he among us MPs, he is also the leader of the Labour party. Frankly, I find it exceedingly scary, just the thought that this traitor to Britain is in the Commons looking shifty,&#8221; a scared MP who dared to speak of Agent Cob, revealed anonymously.</p>

<p>Men with no penises.</p>
<p>Enter, talkshow host, Jimmy Kimmel, a safe bet for the Oscars, which has now been sanitised, and reduced to a bare shell of puritanical socialist rhetoric that decries masculinity and the biological right of men to own a penis.</p>
<p><strong>Propaganda</strong></p>
<p>Suffice to say that Kanye West&#8217;s mother-in-law has more testosterone than the emasculated mangina, Kimmel, who has ingratiated himself in the ways of soviet-style equality propaganda pushes that are ongoing in social media.</p>
<p>Hollywood has thus gone from one extreme to another, from being sexy, to being completely Victorian in its attitude. If one knows their history however, the Victorians indulged in lots of sex in private, however prudish and puritanical they seemed in public.</p>
<p>Neutering the essence of Hollywood is thus the role Kimmel has in mind, and he certainly does a good job brown nosing to the Marxist equality commission in charge of emasculating all men in the media.</p>
<p>Let us cut off all men&#8217;s penises and castrate all men, they cry to loud applause from the compliant drone audience.</p>
<p>Well, in that case, you first Jimmy Kimmel, you snivelling yellow gelding, cut off your manhood, and walk the talk.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>The EU much like the Mafia, is almost impossible to extricate from. In the Mafia, there are only two ways to exit, death or betrayal and lifelong anonymity looking over your shoulder.</p>
<p>The EU, we have seen is much like the same as the Mafiosi. The EU winds and side steps at every point avoiding any form of exit of a country it has imprisoned within its economic steel walls. It is a prison without walls you can see, but the walls are there nevertheless.</p>
<p>There is only one way of exiting the EU, that is through non-conformity and disobeying its Stasi rules. That is the only way to go with some form of dignity anyway. Yes, there are other avenues, but these mean that you never leave the strongarm leash of the EU, and are forever tied to its prison rules.</p>
<p>The jailers are the unelected European Union officials of the EU Commission, who are pampered denizens of high class escorts, unlimited expense accounts and international luxury travel. Naturally, these elite few at the top enjoy their vast pay packets, their 18-year-old ladies ushered into their hotel rooms, and their daily gourmet food in Europe&#8217;s finest restaurants. The members of the EU Commission do not want one of their cash cow countries, which provide good tax revenue, to leave. It is almost like a pimp in a bordello losing one of their working girls, it invariably means a loss of income, and then, what if this sets off others leaving? C&#8217;est très dangereux!  Es ist sehr gefährlich!</p>
<p>To see some dissent now in Italy is a relief, however as it has happened countless times, the dissent will be quashed and the European Union will install their own technocrat to restore rule.</p>
<p>Southern Italy has practically been destroyed by mass illegal immigration from Sub Saharan and North Africa. This is the primary reason that the 5Star Movement, has come through so well in the recent election.</p>
<p>Whether they will be able to form a legitimate government, coalition or not is a big question, and the EU will be working night and day to thwart this insult to their conquered Italian EU province.</p>
<p>Time to fire up the V8, step on the metal&#8230;andare avanti..</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>Extreme left wing hierarchical elements in tech companies like Google and Facebook are pandering to communist China by the massive global censorship push that is going on right now.</p>
<p>If you run a site that does not exhibit Maoist communist or Marxist rhetoric then you will wonder why your site got deleted from YouTube or Facebook, or was demonetised by Google on Adsense.</p>
<p>This is because the Chinese are taking over the internet right now, and the China market is too lucrative for the tech companies to ignore.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s already too late as the back deals have been done between high ranking communist party officials and the likes of Google.</p>
<p>Sadly, this also signals the end of free speech on the Internet, as the good old days when every opinion was allowed, will soon be a thing of the past. Free speech and its loss will go down the road of privacy, where there is none today. Millenials, for example do not know what privacy is, and the next generation will not know freedom of speech.</p>
<p>YouTube, which is now owned by Google, used to be a nice site. Now it is a miserable soup of Orwellian Marxist censorship where extreme left wing groups like Snopes, the Southern Poverty Law Center, and Defamation League have been given carte blanche to dictate what is allowed and what is not. These censors ultimately follow Chinese communistic dictatorial processes in their censorship.</p>
<p>Suffice to say, any differing opinion to Maoist communist ideology is defined as &#8216;hate speech&#8217; an all encompassing term used to censor freedom of expression, art, satire, political opinion.</p>
<p>Therefore, globally, it now looks like China, this great communist juggernaut that has been nurtured and allowed to grow by the West like some huge puss filled pustule, has effectively conquered the Western ideals of democracy through the back door, the tech companies, which already have a monopolistic octopus grip over every facet of the Internet, are following the route of totalitarian dictatorial regimes like communist China.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, we have been sold out, we have been betrayed, and there is nothing we can do about it now. It is too late. The tenets of Western democracy, free speech, and free expression are now officially dead.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it&#8217;s only going to get a lot worse from now on.</p>

<p>Therefore, John Major, former Tory PM, and europhile, is wrong, wrong, wrong in trying to reverse the will of the British people who voted to leave in the EU referendum.</p>
<p>When 17.4 million people voted in the democratically held EU referendum to leave the European Union, they meant it then, and they mean it now.</p>
<p>John Major was a thoroughly unexceptional prime minister, and as he has got it wrong today, he continually got it wrong in the past too.</p>
<p><strong> Black Wednesday 16 September 1992</strong></p>
<p>In 1992, John Major made a serious judgemental mistake that cost Britain dearly. He tried to keep the UK in the ERM (Exchange Rate Mechanism) causing massive market upheaval and leading to Britain leaving anyway.</p>
<p>His poor judgement was also seen in his disastrous role in the (CAR) Common Agricultural Policy in 1992.</p>
<p>John Major, you are wrong, wrong, wrong.</p>
<p>However much Soros and his cronies are paying you through the Open Society foundation, please give the envelopes of money back. You are already well looked after with a decent pension you greedy grey salmonella egg rogering whiffle whaffle.</p>
<p>Please go away Mr Major. You are a listless limp loser who has had his day. Dredging you up from your coffin is the last thing anyone needs.</p>
<p>Britain made its judgement to leave the EU and whatever you say will not change a thing. The British people spoke already, and you must respect the will of the people you deluded cantankerous old fool.</p>

<p>Here is a site built up primarily by Alex Jones, a man passionate in libertarian rights, who is circumnavigating the blatant censorship by media forces by selling his own brand of health products, just so that he can continue running the show. Jones has every right to do and say what he is saying.</p>
<p>Down in the trenches, the Daily Squib has also been affected by the Google push to clamp down on free speech, and censor the Internet of any thought that does not follow socialist viewpoints.</p>
<p>We were booted from Google news feed, our site practically erased from search and our YouTube channel demonetised and ghost banned. There were also numerous threats to halt our revenue unless we took down certain articles.</p>
<p>We know first hand that free speech is now under attack from Internet giants who are effectively bullying little minnows like the DS. That tells us that we may be small but what we say has power, because you have gone to great lengths to shut us down at every opportunity. We have fought for ten years tooth and nail for freedom of speech and our right to write our brand of satire.</p>
<p>Alex Jones and his Infowars team have the right to say what they want. So, we may not always agree but you have the right to free speech and we would defend that right with our lives.</p>
<p>What does Google want, an Internet where every opinion is the same? Where the only views you see are written by &#8216;yes men&#8217; on the socialist payroll?</p>
<p>That dystopian vision is something Orwell would have understood in the Ministry of Truth where doublespeak is king and censorship, the norm.</p>
<p>The socialists always claim they are inclusive, progressive and fair. Not from the massive censorship we have seen, you are not. Any opinion other than yours is immediately blacklisted and either deleted or relegated to Internet no man&#8217;s land.</p>
<p>I urge Infowars and all the others to fight, and we will fight beside you in the name of free speech. We will fight with all our might to the last man standing. Fight and never give up our rights.</p>

<p>Dionne Fenwick, a school board member at Grassy Knoll High School in Winstow, Alabama, was one of the key proponents to the new legislation which will train teachers in the use of firearms.</p>
<p>&#8220;First things first. What would you prefer &#8212; an unarmed teacher unable to protect her class from a shooter, or a highly trained gun toting teacher that can shoot an invading shooter and save her class?&#8221;</p>
<p>After the recent tragic shootings in <a href="https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/27415-antifa-shooter-kills-17-trump-supporters-florida-high-school.html">Florida</a> where 17 children lost their lives after a crazed ex-pupil doped up on antidepressants and Antifa brainwashing shot up the school, there was no way of defending the kids. If there had been someone in the school with firearms knowledge, those 17 kids would be alive today.</p>
<p>President Trump has vowed that new legislation will allow teachers to have heavy duty machine guns and pistols in class, just in case there is a shooter scenario.</p>
<p>&#8220;The teachers will be trained in firearms, in safety and taught how to deal with shooters in an emergency situation. The classrooms will have secure areas where the firearms will be kept,&#8221; Bill Emerson, headteacher at Johnson Mitre High School, Michigan, told a recent CNN report.</p>

<p>The Chicago Board of Trade saw orange juice futures (ICE) plunge over 60% wiping off billions in seconds.</p>
<p>&#8220;Folks were buying and buying, like something out of Trading Places, then some schmuck puts up a post Kylie Jenner just updated on her Instagram. The calls for sell were so loud that my ears started to bleed. When the bell went off there were people lying in the pits with nosebleeds, suits ripped and paper everywhere,&#8221; one exhausted trader, who sadly lost $850,000 today revealed.</p>
<p><strong>Oil Futures</strong></p>
<p>Last week, oil futures jumped 45% on Thursday when Kyle Jenner tweeted that she was so glad she filled her gold laminated Range Rover SUV with petrol, and that oil was a really amazing thing that made cars move.</p>
<p>Market analysts for leading Wall Street firm, Shaboing and Shaboing, are baffled and confused and don&#8217;t know what each day holds.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know that this dumb broad has a brain the size of a pea, but she has clever people controlling her marketing. We also know that they&#8217;re making money from the girl, and tell her what to say. So in the morning, they buy up shitloads of x stock whilst it&#8217;s sitting at the bottom. Midday they make a post on Instagram and tell Kylie Jenner to say she likes x product a lot. Literally in seconds the stock price shoots up some, and they make a killing. Goes for shorting too. The only thing is it&#8217;s all fake market manipulation, and frankly stinks like her dad&#8217;s old jock strap.&#8221;</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Agent Cob</strong></p>
<p>It is revealed how Jeremy Corbyn&#8217;s <a href="https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/27498-soviet-agent-cob-service.html">Soviet spymasters</a> had instructed him to throw a copy of Karl Marx&#8217;s book Das Kapital over a garden fence in Hyde Park, London, if he wanted to contact them.</p>
<p>It was also revealed how he was told to carry a squash ball when meeting his handler, who would wear a pair of gloves and carry a red carnation as a “recognition signal”.</p>
<p>On another occasion he was instructed to meet his Soviet contacts at a certain table in the Stags Head pub in Islington, north London, and would signal his Soviet handlers by clicking his heels seven and a half times, then spinning around four times whilst whistling the East German anthem a semitone above its normal register.</p>
<p>When in parliament, if MP Jeremy Corbyn picked his nose twice, this would reveal a signal to spies that Margaret Thatcher would not be attending that day, however if he picked his nose then ate the bogie, this signal meant she would be attending. However, if he picked his nose, then smeared the bogie on another MP&#8217;s jacket, this would mean the PM would be delayed by a few minutes.</p>
<p>If in danger, Corbyn would signal to his Soviet masters by clucking like a chicken then conducting a series of semi-circle maneuvers whilst simultaneously dragging his left foot behind him and jumping slightly to the left.</p>
<p><strong>Highly Trained Soviet Operative</strong></p>
<p>According to former Soviet spymasters, Jeremy Corbyn was also trained in the usage of many spy tools including special gadgets like listening devices, carrier pigeons and abseiling techniques.</p>
<p>Trained in the dark espionage arts, Corbyn would casually pass on British state secrets to his handlers via carrier pigeon. The specially trained pigeons would be acquired at Trafalgar Square after midnight from on top of the fourth lion statue to the right, then flown to clandestine addresses across London.</p>
<p><strong>House of Commons</strong></p>
<p>The files, released for the first time, disclosed how Corbyn revealed details of Margaret Thatcher&#8217;s movements and if she was wearing underwear or not on the day of attendance at the House of Commons. This information was crucial to the Soviets for some reason, and Agent Cob never questioned why.</p>
<p>If Maggie was wearing underwear on the day of attendance, this would be signalled by Jeremy Corbyn with a series of grunts, and he would hold his breath for a few minutes until his face went red. If Corbyn saw that Mrs Thatcher had not worn any underwear, by utilising his Soviet mirror gadget, he would hoot like an owl, then scratch his crotch four times whilst moving backwards.</p>
<p>One of Corbyn&#8217;s contacts, Agent 9, would hold a red book in his hands whenever they met. This signal meant that it was okay to talk freely, however if he held a black book, this would mean that they had to go elsewhere to converse.</p>
<p>Corbyn was also trained in stealth techniques, as well as military grade combat. His shoes were specially fitted with spikes laced with deadly poison, and would be deployed by clicking the heels three times.</p>
<p>As a last resort, Agent Cob was also given a cyanide pill just in case he was ever found out by the British secret services and interrogated.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>Former Cold War Soviet spy, Comrade Corbyn is angry with the media after being outed as an informant to Soviet Russia recently.</p>
<p>Speaking at his dacha in Islington, the supreme leader of the Labour party said that &#8220;changes would be coming&#8221; to press freedom.</p>
<p>Analyst, Borgmer Lynns, revealed the truth of Corbyn&#8217;s deadly message.</p>
<p>&#8220;What Corbyn is effectively saying is he will squash press freedom and make Britain look like Soviet Russia, or Stasi East Germany during the Cold War. Seeing as he was a spy for the Soviets, as recalled by Czech spy, Jan Sarkocy, who recruited Corbyn in the 1980s, he has a real affinity for the machinations of the Cold War era. He wants to introduce it into Britain with mass censorship and threats.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Pravda</strong></p>
<p>The Corbyn press model would be to nationalise all newspapers, where all editorial decisions would have to go through a central Soviet committee linked to the Labour party.</p>
<p>This is already occurring with the BBC, who after a week of media reports of Corbyn&#8217;s spy past had been revealed, had still barely acknowledged the news, and refused to report on it so as to protect their leader and party chief. The BBC is the official voice of the Labour party and supports its soviet ideals with extreme passion.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">The offices of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pravda#Soviet_period"><em>Pravda</em></a> newspaper were transferred to Moscow on March 3, 1918 when the Soviet capital was moved there. <i>Pravda</i> became an official publication, or &#8220;organ&#8221;, of the Soviet Communist Party. <i>Pravda</i> became the conduit for announcing official policy and policy changes and would remain so until 1991. Subscription to <i>Pravda</i> was mandatory for state run companies, the armed services and other organizations until 1989.</p>
<p>Other newspapers like the Daily Telegraph, Daily Mail, the Sun, the Times, and Express, would be ordered to tow the Labour soviet line or force being shut down.</p>
<p>If Labour comes into power under Comrade Corbyn, many would flee the former nation of Britain and take their business to places where democracy still resides.</p>

<p>When the collapse comes, there will be complete disorder and chaos. Banks will shut, all social security will stop, and all emergency services will eventually be forced to stop after being inundated.</p>
<p>Naturally, disorder and collapse of all financial services will result in rioting in the streets accompanied with mass looting of all businesses and rich people in their homes.</p>
<p>No food and water for three days will make any population, however civilised beforehand, into wild savages.</p>
<p>One must remember that disorder in the West, is a trigger for the West&#8217;s enemies to strike. Therefore, China, Iran, N.Korea and Russia would capitalise on the chaos.</p>
<p>Striking while your enemy is at his weakest is a sure way for success in any military attack.</p>
<p>The precept for invasion could also be cloaked in aiding the West, where they move troops in to keep order on the premise of helping whichever nation they are invading.</p>
<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ltgo2D7MfhU" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>South China Sea and All That</strong></p>
<p>This is why New Zealand, and Australia, which are only a ship ride away from China would be one of the first places to be attacked. <a href="https://www.thetrumpet.com/14094-ready-to-attack-china-threatens-australia">China</a> has had its eye on Australia for some time, and who is to say they won&#8217;t have an eye on New Zealand as well?</p>
<p>Peter Thiel, and his billionaire friends would thus be rounded up just like everyone else and sent to re-education camps or communist Chinese gulags. Remember that the Chinese are desperate for land, and Australia/New Zealand have plenty for its needs.</p>
<p>When it comes to swarm warfare, China wins hands down, nothing will get in their way, and the millions of fighting men and women of the Chinese military are a formidable force.</p>
<p>The billionaires who are buying plots of land in New Zealand now can only be labelled as misinformed idiots with too much money and no sense.</p>
<p>Are you that fucking stupid, blinded by your riches that you do cannot see the immediate threat lying directly above Australia? Idiots.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>The Broccoli family insisted that ex-soviet spy MP, Jeremy Corbyn should be cast as the arch villain in the new James Bond film.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were going to do the film about Spectre, but after seeing the news about Jezza being a soviet spy in the eighties, right under everyone&#8217;s noses, we were intrigued. He is still an MP and leader of the Labour party and is sincerely hoping to seize revolutionary Bolshevik power soon. Old Jezza could take over the world and change it into some sort of communist collectivist allotment where everyone grows prize courgettes and marrows year in year out,&#8221; Cubby Broccoli&#8217;s niece, Jennifer Lettuce, told the Times.</p>
<p>The plot change for the film has been quite time consuming for the writers but when opportunities like this arise, one has to seize the bull by the horns, or in Jeremy Corbyn&#8217;s words, the Czech spy by the cheque book.</p>
<p>Jeremy Corbyn was allegedly paid a measly sum of £10,000 for the information he handed over to the soviets in the 1980s, but in the film, he will be demanding over a million quid. This money is then funnelled into a cultist secretive group called Momentum.</p>
<p>&#8220;The secret to a good Bond film is always the villain. This is why Jeremy Corbyn will be ideal, because he has actually lived the life of a spy. Daniel Craig, who is meant to be James Bond hasn&#8217;t ever met a real spy before, and he is really chuffed about working with Jeremy,&#8221; the film&#8217;s director, Johnson Marx, told media outlets on Monday.</p>

View with caution.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>The new Black Panther film is atrocious, and no one with any standards should go and see it, unless you catch it on an internet streaming site for free. People should not fund such a ridiculous racially divisive film which glorifies black supremacy and racism entertwined in impossible fantasy.</p>
<p>In the isolationist fictional world of Wakanda; no immigration is allowed, the city has large walls around it, is a homogeneous ethno-state where only black people are allowed, and promotes black supremacy over all other races. Just reverse the colour and you get Trump&#8217;s vision of America.</p>
<p>Amongst this utopian fantasy world lives black superheros with insane technology that can only be dreamed of, and is not close to reality in any way.</p>
<p>Who designed this technological cornucopia of immense intricacy and superior advancement? The Wakanda crew can barely string a sentence together let alone create anti-gravity tech or nano suits which defy the laws of physics.</p>
<p>The reality of Africa is that it is a continent of great resources but poor function. There is huge poverty in the continent and a film like this is a disgrace to Africans. It is essentially saying, if we were clever enough we could have the technology of the West within this fantasy but we don&#8217;t, the reality thus bites even more, and insults the African states of today who have very little technological advancement or technical knowhow.</p>
<p>Apart from the brilliant Blade series, the only real black superhero seen on screen has to be &#8216;Ghost Dog&#8217; with Forest Whitaker, who was not essentially a Marvel superhero but one of superhuman strength and intellect, thanks to diligent study of the Hagakure. Okay, Forest took the pay cheque for Black Panther, but we should not begrudge him on that.</p>
<p>The director of Black Panther, Ryan Coogler, is obviously a black supremacist as can be seen in all his previous efforts, and his vision is one of complete domination of all by the black race. This is therefore not about equality, but supremacy, and where all other races are subjugated by the &#8216;superior&#8217; black race.</p>
<p>In essence, if this film were made of a race other than black, it would be panned as deeply racist, however because there is a special card for African Americans, it is instead lauded, and promoted as the next big thing since sliced bread. Double standards for African Americans, mixed in with hypocrisy and affirmative action.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t go and see this fantasy film that disregards everything about African reality, instead please give to the many aid charities in Africa who really need the help.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>Why are people surprised that Jeremy Corbyn gave away <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5401097/Jeremy-Corbyn-paid-Czech-secret-police-spy-claims.html">British secrets</a> and crucial information to the Soviets in the 1980s?</p>
<p>Certainly, here is a man who is a staunch Marxist who wants to come into power and create a Soviet dictatorship in the UK.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Mr Sarkocy, who was expelled from the UK by Margaret Thatcher and now lives in Bratislava, said that the information revealed by the MP – whose codename was Agent Cob – was “rated in Moscow as the number one”. </em><strong>Source: <em><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/02/16/jeremy-corbyn-knew-spy-cold-war-source-says-czech-diplomat/">DT</a></em></strong></p>
<p>One can only imagine the amount of state secrets Comrade Corbyn handed over to the Soviets during the eighties, however one thing is sure, the people who are supporting Corbyn are supporting someone who is a danger to national interests and has allegedly caused great harm to the UK in the past by collaborating with its enemies.</p>
<p>Should something be done about this? Well, of course, but it seems the sanitised MI6 are just sitting on their fingers, and everyone else is brushing it under the carpet.</p>
<p>In the last elections, when Corbyn nearly came to power, Sir Richard Dearlove, the former head of MI6, warned that &#8220;Mr Corbyn could not be trusted as prime minister and that, rather than be allowed to run the security services, he would previously have been investigated by them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Is anyone going to act on the new information that has come to light? Surely, someone or some agency, or some entity must investigate further, and bring Corbyn to justice.</p>
<p>Naturally, this news has not been reported by the BBC.</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t have a former Soviet spy running the country, especially someone who sought to harm Britain by giving away information that put us in danger. Anyone out there? Anyone?</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>Investigative journalist <a href="https://pjmedia.com/video/sharyl-attkisson-explains-tedx-talk-origins-2016-fake-news-narrative/">Sharyl Attkinson</a> has revealed after extensive research into the Fake News purge on many sites across the internet, that Google&#8217;s former CEO, Eric Schmidt was the mastermind behind it all.</p>
<p>His modus operandi was to smear any news site that held alternative views to the democrats, and Hillary Clinton during and after the 2016 election.</p>
<p>Our site has suffered a lot from Google&#8217;s bias because satire was wrongly labelled as &#8216;fake news&#8217;, and we were numerously threatened by Google, to remove satirical material or face the consequences. We have also been demonetized and shadow banned on YouTube. Our site was also ejected from Google news feed during the fake news fiasco.</p>
<p class="newLineContentFilterParagraph" style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;Digging deeper, she discovered that Google was one of the big donors behind First Draft&#8217;s &#8220;fake news&#8221; messaging. Google&#8217;s parent company, Alphabet, was run by Eric Schmidt, who happened to be a huge Hillary Clinton supporter.</p>
<p class="newLineContentFilterParagraph" style="padding-left: 30px;">Schmidt &#8220;offered himself up as a campaign adviser and became a top multi-million donor to it. His company funded First Draft around the start of the election cycle,&#8221; Attkisson said. &#8220;Not surprisingly, Hillary was soon to jump aboard the anti-fake news train and her surrogate David Brock of Media Matters privately told donors he was the one who convinced Facebook to join the effort.&#8221;</p>
<p class="newLineContentFilterParagraph" style="padding-left: 30px;">Attkisson declared that &#8220;the whole thing smacked of the roll-out of a propaganda campaign.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Daily Squib <a href="https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/opinion/26718-the-intrinsic-difference-between-satire-and-fake-news.html">surmised</a> itself that the Fake News scheme was a way for the democrats to purge any form of alternative or conservative thought through censorship and labelling it as fake news. We never thought however that Google would be behind all of this, and are frankly disgusted, but not surprised.</p>
<p>This whole sorry fake news debacle just shows the inherent power Google has over the internet and how it uses its power for the purposes of bias, corruption and censorship of large swathes of internet websites for its own ends.</p>
<p>One thing about free speech is that every viewpoint should be heard, however much one disagrees with any viewpoint, it has a right to be heard. Censorship and bias thwarts the true tenets of democracy.</p>
<p>By trying to artificially skew thought and literature, one dwells into the world of totalitarianism and dictatorship, essentially what Google has become.</p>
<p>The only good thing about Google at the moment is Ray Kurzweil, who we are great fans of, and hope he is using his job to really move things forward in a positive way.</p>
<p>Schmidt is now the head of an advisory board at the <a href="http://www.defenseone.com/technology/2018/01/heres-how-stop-squelching-new-ideas-eric-schmidts-advisory-board-tells-dod/145240/">Pentagon</a>, and is now teaching them the dark arts of manipulation, disinformation and propaganda for the internet age.</p>

<p>The alleged <a href="https://twitter.com/OfficialAntifa/status/963895170524688385">ANTIFA</a> member, adopted the communist, Marxist ideology utilised by the far left group which is supported by George Soros, Hillary Clinton, the Obamas, and other important American democrats.</p>
<p>The killing spree started when Cruz set off the fire alarm so he could shoot more people funnelling through the corridors.</p>
<p>As Cruz was a member of ANTIFA, and clearly supported their extreme left-wing communist ideology there are several motives for his actions.</p>
<p>Firstly, ANTIFA is about disarming Americans, they are anti-gun, therefore what better way to bring up the anti-gun message again with another school massacre, secondly, he could have been targeting conservative students, especially Trump supporters, thirdly, he was angry at being expelled.</p>

<p>Of course, Cruz, like many of his communist brethren is brainwashed into the cause of revolution, this can only be done by violence.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>
<p>What kind of white supremacist shoots a bunch of white people?</p>
<p>Some MSM news services are now claiming that Cruz is in fact a far right wing Trump supporter who joined a supremacist paramilitary group that they conveniently do not name. This news is however hard to believe, especially when the Hispanic Cruz was registered to vote as a democrat. Hispanic democrat voters are not allowed in white supremacist groups. Naturally, there will be smoke and mirrors put out by certain agencies and factions, so it is hard to believe what is truth or not. One has to look at the facts, and if people suddenly appear out of nowhere claiming something, there must be questions asked, especially if the articles show very little evidence of what they are claiming, with no actual sources or names.</p>
<p><strong>FURTHER UPDATE</strong></p>
<p>MSM reports that Cruz was affiliated with white supremacist groups has been refuted by the Anti-Defamation League who backed away from their previous claims.</p>
<div class="trb_ar_page" data-role="pagination_page" data-content-page="1">
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Detectives are investigating a possible connect between Cruz and a small, Florida-based white supremacist group called the Republic of Florida, which seeks to create a “white ethnostate” in Florida. But the Anti-Defamation League, an organization that monitors hate groups, has backed away from its initial report that Cruz had been involved with that group.</p>
</div>
<div class="trb_ar_page" data-role="pagination_page" data-content-page="2">
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The league put out a statement saying that a representative of the group, who had earlier claimed Cruz was involved, now says he had been “misunderstood.”</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>Liberals and politically correct censors who censor linguistic language inadvertently make those censored words more powerful, more delicious, and liberating to use.</p>
<p>Every day, we hear of another word in the English language that has been banned by the people who think they control speech, however what they are doing is strengthening the very word they seek to ban.</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re at home or in the car, you can say those words with a devilish glee, however you cannot say them in public without being called out by the pc-police and their mission to shut down language. These banned words increase in power everytime they are censored.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but these words may offend someone?&#8221; they cry, yet their censorship offends people who value free speech.</p>
<p>We are continually told that we have to like &#8216;selected&#8217; people. You have to like them. You are forced to like them because it is the politically correct thing to do, but can you force people to like people they want nothing to do with, and NEVER will?</p>
<p>Can you force someone to like things they just have nothing in common with? According to the globalist, this is called tolerance, however stick one of these high hat globalists in a room full of these people and you will soon see intolerance. The elite globalist may dictate you live among these people, yet they live themselves in secluded luxury away from the detritus.</p>
<p>Even the most tolerant people can get fucking pissed off.</p>
<p>It should be ones given right to detest others as they wish, and even to display this if they want, however in polite society this is a no, no.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>Doctors and physicians have come together to label the painter who painted the Michelle Obama portrait as someone with severe visual impairment problems that technically make her blind.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t know how she can function in daily life, let alone be procured to paint the official portrait of the former first lady, Michael Obama?&#8221; Hernandez Consellio M.D, is the Director of the UCLA Laser Refractive Center and Clinical Professor of Ophthalmology at the Cataract and Refractive Surgery Division at the world renowned Weinstein Eye Institute.</p>
<p>Many experts in the mechanics of eyesight and Ophthalmology have asked the painter to come in and get urgent help as she is in danger of not only hurting herself but others too.</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean does this woman drive a car or operate heavy machinery? She is a danger to herself and others and must seek urgent medical assistance,&#8221; eye surgeon, Balthazar Medley M.D. appealed on Monday.</p>
<p>According to the Obamas, the painter of the Michelle Obama portrait only got the role because of &#8216;affirmative action&#8217;.</p>
<p>In the United States, even though some black people may not be qualified or able to do a job, they are still given the role not for their ability but for the colour of their skin. For many, this is seen as &#8216;positive discrimination&#8217; and is not a justified way to run employment, however it is a valid American system and has been running for many years.</p>
<p>The painter of the Michelle Obama portrait, Ambingo Shaquanda Fantasay, was adamant that the portrait she painted is what she saw:</p>
<p>&#8220;I axe her, I said is that you Michelle, she say yeah? I thanked her fo&#8217; da job. So I painted whut was in ma mind of whut I thought I saw.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blind artists in the art world are not rare. Last year, deaf, dumb and blind artist, Damien Hirst sold one of his paintings for £4.8 million.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>Working for a charity has never been so lucrative, what with astronomical salaries given to parasites who ponce around behind their desks pretending to help suffering people in need.</p>
<p>Oxfam have been caught indulging in orgies in sunny Carribean climes, according to the news, and to capitulate on this, the charity have decided to capitalise on the frenzied mass media coverage and free publicity.</p>
<p><strong>Oxfam Orgies to Fund Another Salary Increase</strong></p>
<p>Oxfam marketing manager, Celia Ortens, salary £465,000/annum, who works for the company only three days a week, reveals the plan:</p>
<p>&#8220;Orgies are good for headlines. We need to up our salaries, so we will be holding Fundraising Orgies in the Bahamas every two weeks ongoing. To attend the orgy, each participant has to pay $60,000.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to the Oxfam accountant, Bernie Fenster, all it will take is a participation of &#8220;200 orgy fuckers every two weeks so that Oxfam HQ staff can have another pay rise&#8221;.</p>
<p>With most charities only giving away 1% of their take to charity work, and the rest to massive lucrative salaries, plane flights, unlimited expense accounts, parties, taxis and alcohol, most sane people do not give money to charities, however, the world is not filled with sane people it seems and charities bring in millions every day.</p>
<p>Speaking from one of her mansions, Ms Ortens revealed that the orgies will include anything that has ever been thought of or conceived in history.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Romans liked their orgies, and we will certainly include as much from that era as today&#8217;s Tinderized Bachinalian sex riddled internet generation. As for things like AIDS and other STIs, well, like <a href="https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/21136-hook-sites-tinder-grindr-good-population-control.html">Tinder</a>, we do not discriminate. If you want to go for it, why be a downer? Our orgies have a condition where everything is allowed &#8212; as long as you pay the price at the door, because you will certainly be paying the price when you walk out the door.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Oxfam Orgies will start in Nassau, Bahamas in April, then much like a hurricane move through the Caribbean islands. Charity worker, David Miliband, whose salary is <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/744821/foreign-aid-DFID-David-Miliband-International-Rescue-Committee-Marc-Van-Ameringen">£530,000</a> per annum was consulted on the Oxfam Orgies, and agreed it is a great idea, and he might even attend a few.</p>

<p>Certainly, there is no secret to George Soros funding the most hated woman in Britain to stop Brexit.</p>
<p><strong>Can George Soros thwart Brexit?</strong></p>
<p>All the Remoaner MPs and other cohorts of money obsessed traitors are given the impetus to act against Brexit, especially when they are handed brown envelopes or suitcases full of money.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/27029-much-eu-paying-tony-blair-destroy-brexit.html">treachery</a> of those in government who accept these payments to Remoan and thwart our democratic right to Brexit is something that is not only despicable but inherently immoral, and some would say illegal.</p>
<p>In these times of treason, even if these money-grabbing cowards get caught in the media spotlight, as has happened with the established Daily Telegraph reporting, they will still get away with murder. The reason being, the underlying establishment who are Remainers are supporting them.</p>
<p>How much wrong has to be committed on the people who voted for Brexit on June 23, 2016 until justice, and a bona fide exit from the EU is conducted?</p>
<p>Leavers have been punished, denigrated and side-stepped for too long.</p>
<p>Now is the time to fight back for democracy and to punish the crooks, scumbags and shit heads who are actively trying destroy our democratic right to leave the EU whilst getting paid huge sums of money by their masters.</p>
<p>Fuck you Soros and fuck you Gina Miller, and all the other crooked Remoaners on the take. You are vile, corrupt criminals.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>A busy <a href="http://www.epica-awards.com/">Epica Awards London Showcase</a> took place on the rooftop of production company <a href="https://www.gcrs.com/">GCRS</a> in Great Marlborough Street on January 31.</p>
<p>The event was designed to give London audiences a chance to enjoy the work awarded at Epica’s ceremony in Berlin in November.</p>
<p>At the well-attended event, creatives Giles Hepworth and Bill Hartley of J. Walter Thompson London were congratulated for their award-winning entry “Ashes to Art”, which led to the agency becoming Epica’s UK agency of the year.</p>
<p><strong>Campaign</strong></p>
<p>Campaign’s global editor-in-chief, Claire Beale, who joined the Epica jury for the first time last year, praised the work.</p>
<p>But she also encouraged more British agencies to enter Epica in the future. “I saw so much inspiring work from other countries; I felt sort of humbled really. It was a fantastic opportunity to appreciate the breadth of work from around the world. But I also thought: ‘Come on the Brits, where are you on this?&#8217;”</p>
<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pgXBiBseA9Q" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.jwt.com/en/">J. Walter Thompson’s</a> campaign involved encouraging artists to turn ashes from a catastrophic <a href="https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/jwt-creatives-turned-glasgow-school-arts-ashes-art/1435904">fire at the Glasgow School of Art</a> into original artwork. This was then auctioned off to help pay for the school’s restoration.</p>
<p>Bill Hartley remarked that the hardest part of the campaign was convincing the artists themselves to take part. “In the end we resorted to good old-fashioned direct mail, sending them charred pieces of wood in the post.”</p>
<p><strong>Creative Review</strong></p>
<p>Regular Epica juror Eliza Williams, associate editor of <a href="https://www.creativereview.co.uk/">Creative Review</a>, remarked that the awards show had seen an increase in brand-purposed or charity work recently. She added: “The best thing for me is not only seeing the work, but getting the journalists’ impression of it…You get a perspective that perhaps you don’t get in any other setting.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Daily Squib</strong></p>
<p>First time attendee at the Epica soiree, Daily Squib editor, and champion of creativity, Aur Esenbel, was truly impressed by the show of advertising and media talent: &#8220;Meeting with Mark Tungate and other denizens of the advertising, publishing world was inspiring.</p>
<p>&#8220;It has been a great honour to have been accepted as a <a href="http://www.epica-awards.com/awards/jury">juror for the creative Epica awards</a>, and one has to say that the essence of all creative work lies in intricate controlled chaotic exploration.</p>
<p>&#8220;Defining that singular moment in the creative process when out of the ether, the creative plucks out an idea, an essence, a cherished spark that is then catapulted further with experimentation and work, to eventually create the final polished output, is not easily described.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyday, the Daily Squib works its creative juices whether in literature or illustration, and we are dedicated to the field of Creative Science in constructing our satire and news stories.</p>
<p>&#8220;In line with Claire Beale, from Campaign magazine, the Epica Awards definitely needs more British input. Hopefully in 2018, the awards will see a bigger Brit emphasis.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once again, thank you to the Epica team, and sponsors for holding such an event, and for inviting the Daily Squib to participate, it has been a true honour.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Epica Awards Director &#8211; Mark Tungate</strong></p>
<p>Epica editorial director <a href="https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/opinion/26252-interview-author-creative-epica-awards-editorial-director-mark-tungate.html">Mark Tungate</a> extended a warm thanks to GCRS for hosting the evening for the second year running. He also thanked the other sponsors: Adobe, Euronews, Screen Vision and Global Production Network. Film CataCover, which provides weather insurance for shoots, sponsored the drinks.</p>
<p>Tungate added: “The event was as good-humoured as last year’s. Networking and socialising around a reel of outstanding creative work is a great way of shrugging off the gloom of January.”</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>Anna Soubry protects the EU like the devil&#8217;s maiden, Mrs. Baylock protecting the Antichrist Damien in the Omen series of films.</p>
<p>Such is her crazed EU obsessive look and her mad spiky hair that to see her walk down the halls of Westminster, many get out of her way so as not to catch that stare in her demonic EU maddened eyes.</p>
<p>She lives for the EU, and she will certainly die for it too, her glazed over eyes pointing backwards, and the spittle foaming at her mouth.</p>
<p>The devil&#8217;s maiden, Anna Soubry, has planted herself somehow into the Conservative party, and within it she wreaks havoc, constantly preaching about how great her satanic masters are in Brussels, and how leaving the curtain of evil in the EU will destroy Britain.</p>
<p>Whenever there&#8217;s a parliamentary debate, Anna Soubry suddenly appears out of a hidden door, with a puff of smoke, this demonic feral creature and her furry raspy tongue spits out vitriol against anyone who values Britain&#8217;s freedom from the EU. She is against freedom, she is only for the EU and its heaving laws of certain imprisonment.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-27343" src="https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Anna-Soubry-demonic-eu-maiden-1024x538.png" alt="Anna-Soubry-demonic-eu-maiden" width="696" height="366" srcset="https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Anna-Soubry-demonic-eu-maiden-1024x538.png 1024w, https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Anna-Soubry-demonic-eu-maiden-300x158.png 300w, https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Anna-Soubry-demonic-eu-maiden-768x403.png 768w, https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Anna-Soubry-demonic-eu-maiden.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" /></p>
<p><strong>So who is Anna Soubry?</strong></p>
<p>Borne from the puckered popping anus of a jackal in a cemetery somewhere in Lincolnshire, this priestess of the infernal was schooled in the dark arts from an early age, and was once a journalist and TV presenter for Grampian Television North.</p>
<p>She somehow appeared in the Conservative party as a plant from her masters in Brussels and has to this day continued to undermine not only the Tories but the Brexit process at every turn.</p>
<p>This evil, festering boil from the leaking asshole of Hades follows the cult of the EU with such fervour and brainwashed dedication that she has had the EU flags tattooed on her buttocks, as well as a hammer and sickle tattoo on her sagging swaying hag breasts.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, no one knows how she got to Westminster? The only thing they know, as MPs and their staff mill around the hallways and offices, is that if she is heard coming, hide, jump, run, get away with you, do not look into her devil eyes, or you too could succumb to her satanic demonic ways as well and forever be damned to Hell.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/12/16/virtual-bitcoin-production-killing-planet/">Mining Bitcoin and other graphic card utilising cryptos is killing the planet</a>. The amount of resources used to mine these heavily electricity reliant currencies is causing an ecological disaster.</p>
<p>Look at the Bitcoin farms in China/ Russia/ Iceland/ America where vast amounts of electricity are used to mine these coins, where the amount of heat generated by these number crunching GPU/ASIC graphics modules have to be cooled down.</p>
<p>As network difficulty rises, so do the numbers of machines introduced into the mining chain, causing even more ecological damage.</p>
<p><strong>The solution = Burstcoin.</strong></p>
<p>Burstcoin is mined solely by hard disks which use minimal amounts of electricity and when not mining are dormant.</p>
<p>Burstcoin, instead of being embraced by crypto users has instead been wholly ignored but this is a danger, especially as it is the cryptocurrency that is not only ecologically efficient but run in a way that is SAFE. Yes, safety is a paramount concern in the world of cryptocurrencies, and Burstcoin is the safest most efficient coin around.</p>
<p>In this time of financial turmoil in the world of economics and stockmarkets, Burstcoin is a solid, green, eco-friendly, private, secure cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Hell, even <a href="https://twitter.com/officialmcafee/status/944206175100424193?lang=en">John McAfee</a> says so, and who are we to disagree with him.</p>

<p>Cryptocurrency users worldwide must see the benefits of Burstcoin.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t think just about the money, but think about our planet too.</p>
<p>Everytime you use the other heavy electricity usage GPU/ASIC mining currencies you are effectively damaging finite resources on this planet.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>The usually comatose fear index (VIX) has jumped 115.60% and is rising by the hour.</p>
<p>Stockbrokers are running around their offices scurrying like rats from a sinking ship!</p>
<p>Investors are getting the fear..like serious fear.</p>
<p>If Bitcoin can drop like a rock, why not legitimate stocks?</p>
<p>Maybe this is revenge by the hackers and dark netters after their Bitcoin high was spiked by various governments.</p>
<p>It only makes sense, if governments want to hurt Crypto, the hackers and users on the dark net will fight back.</p>
<p>Shit flies when the shit storm hits, and fear rises faster than it takes a margin call to liquidate your positions.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-27308" src="https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/FEAR-INDEX-VIX-300x236.png" alt="" width="620" height="489" srcset="https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/FEAR-INDEX-VIX-300x236.png 300w, https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/FEAR-INDEX-VIX-768x605.png 768w, https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/FEAR-INDEX-VIX.png 793w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></p>
<p>Sure, this could be a correction, hang in there, maybe even buy more, but what if it ain&#8217;t, you&#8217;ll be locked in as the stocks hit the floor, your once tidy profit now a worthless piece of shit.</p>
<p>Can you seriously watch the whole market drop while holding? No, siree! Better to dump, keep what cash you have.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also the Democrats, obviously they are enjoying this every moment with avid appreciation at the destruction of the Teflon Don, but what if the Dems engineered this fall? Well, they&#8217;ll hurt their people as much as others, although the hierarchy will only see that as collateral damage, and a necessary evil.</p>
<p>Who frickin&#8217; knows what will happen now? The fall is contagious as much as fear is, and it spreads like wildfire, it speeds up, accelerates and burns every corner of the global financial markets.</p>
<p>Some say we need to burn sometimes, but c&#8217;mon, it&#8217;s way better to ride the waves of a bull market than suffer the burn of a bear market. If you can short, that&#8217;s good for you, you should have been shorting from 26,000. Bully for you, you&#8217;re actually making a packet right now, and it&#8217;s going to drop further.</p>
<p>Silicon valley, the place where all the big geeks and companies live will be hit, we&#8217;re talking Google, Amazon and Facebook. Their fat smiles will be wiped off their faces as tech stocks smash into the ground leaving their once-upon-a-time billionaire faces nursing some serious smacked ass hole grimaces.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, the carnage is only just beginning and the VIX tells all. Two things rule this world, FEAR and GREED. The carrot or the stick. At this moment in time, that stick is beating down hard, and if you don&#8217;t get your money out, there won&#8217;t be a pension, there won&#8217;t be a nice holiday home, or a retirement fund, it will all be a dream people once had, and it&#8217;s all gone, like a sniff of the panties of that girl you had only once, never to be encountered ever again.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>The Dow may have dropped 1,500 from a high of 26k, but look on the bright side folks, inflation is rising at an astronomical level.</p>
<p>What that means is everything just keeps getting more expensive. Your credit cards, mortgages and all the other shit created by bankers to siphon off money from your wallets at ridiculously high rates.</p>
<p>Will we see further drops in the stockmarket? Ah, it&#8217;ll go sideways here for awhile, consolidation, then up a teeny bit, but mostly down from now on.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t blame Trump, this is cyclical, and cannot be controlled.</p>
<p>We wrote about the <a href="https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/business/26491-interior-knowledge-stock-market-pop-soon.html">bubble popping</a> awhile ago, last year to be precise, and here we are.</p>
<p>The Dow dropping 1,600 points is a drop in the ocean though when the market falls 60% then there will be cause for concern.</p>
<p>How can you tell where the bottom is? That&#8217;s a hard one, almost like trying to find the highest high, but the lowest low will be the place where buying interest starts again. At the moment the stockmarket is so overbought that there is no intrinsic link to reality in the economy. Corrections are a natural phase.</p>
<p>There may be acceleration in momentum on the downside, if this occurs, don&#8217;t bother phoning the broker, the phone will be off the hook. Just gently put your head between your legs and kiss your stocks goodbye.</p>
<p>Sit back, break out the Schlitz, dip in the popcorn, and fucking relax&#8230;but only if you sold everything like yesterday.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap" style="background-color: #333333;">T</span>he EU is a Soviet construct utilising collectivist techniques to strip former sovereign nations of their ability to construct their own laws, and dictating fiscal rules that rob former nations of making their own economic decisions.</p>
<p>Ruled by an unelected core of technocrats, the EU Commission, they answer to no one, unlike a democracy where elected officials answer to an electorate.</p>
<p>Ask any European to name one single person who rules over them in the EU Commission, and you will get a blank answer. The sad part about this is that the regular EU citizen is not phased by this, instead they go on living their simple lives without questioning anything.</p>
<p>After the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, the Soviet officials in the <a href="https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/19215-berlin-wall-fell-1989-east-german-stasi-took-reigns-eu.html">Eastern German communist government</a> were integrated into the EU ruling hierarchy.</p>
<p>Today we are seeing the fruits of their endeavours, with an EU so closely integrated that it is nigh on impossible for a nation to remove itself from the dictatorial structure.</p>
<p>The UK may never leave the EU because of the various Marxist economic rules intertwined within its makeup. In the unlikely event that Britain does manage to escape this Eurocommunist construct, one can only pity the nations left behind, who will have the rest of their sovereignty eviscerated and integrated into &#8216;Ever Closer Union&#8217;.</p>
<p>To see the proud Gaelic Irish race, who fought tooth and nail to gain freedom from rule for thousands of years, join the EU without even a whimper, not even a fight is sad beyond belief. These proud fighters have condemned their nation and people to be ruled as slaves by Brussels, where their every move is dictated, where their every law is ordered and where their every economic decision is instated without their say. To fight for thousands of years, then surrender your sovereignty without a single fight is a sign that there are defeated people amongst us, and the Irish are a lost race in the EU.</p>
<p>Socialists, Marxists, and <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/899684/Brexit-Darkest-Hour-Gary-Oldman-Winston-Churchill-Colin-Firth">ill-informed</a> actors, always cite Winston Churchill as wanting this communist sovietised EU construct, but they are wrong, <a href="https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/16803-what-churchill-really-thought-of-the-european-union.html">Churchill hated communism</a>, and to see a massive communist bloc emerge in Europe would have frightened his political sensibilities. His vision of a European future was to see an Anglo-Franco union, but this never happened. Instead, we now have a Germano-Franco union ruling over the subsidiary countries.</p>
<p>The Soviet style that the EU has adopted is more of a Maoist modern Chinese communistic counterpart incorporating little utopian bits like the free-movement amongst all states Schengen Zone. EU communism can also be coined as the New Communism, or Eurocommunism. Economically speaking, the EU values capitalism, and yet is communist, much like China which embraces free market capitalism opposed to communist economics, yet is still a communist state.</p>
<p>Mikhail Gorbachev once commented after the fall of the Berlin wall: &#8220;The most puzzling development in politics during the last decade is the apparent determination of Western European leaders to re-create the Soviet Union in Western Europe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Current Russian leader, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/4480745.stm">Vladimir Putin</a> has said: &#8220;Above all, we should acknowledge that the collapse of the Soviet Union was a major geopolitical disaster of the century. As for the Russian nation, it became a genuine drama. Tens of millions of our co-citizens and co-patriots found themselves outside Russian territory. Moreover, the epidemic of disintegration infected Russia itself.&#8221;</p>
<p>And from this disintegration of Old Soviet Russia came a New Soviet EUnion construct deep in the heart of Europe, called the European Union, and in the future, it will admit what it really is, &#8216;The Soviet European Union&#8217;. As for Russia, the plan probably highest in EU military circles, within the newly formed EU Army will be integration of Russia. From there, Putin and his cronies will have their old Soviet state back, that is if they survive the purges.</p>
<p>Modern communism within the EU is softened down version much like China, where religion is tolerated relatively, and there is heavy use of censorship to limit alternative viewpoints to its socialist ideologies.</p>
<p>In essence, the EU wants to spread as far as it can go. The planners deep in the EU Commission would like the EU  to take over the world economically, much like they have conquered European nations, without a single shot being fired. What the EU is is the <a href="https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/10457-eu-nazi-germany-backwards-say-historians.html">Fourth Reich backwards</a>. Where Hitler began militarily to conquer Europe, the EU conquered Europe economically. Once this was completed, this is when it was safe to talk about creating an <a href="https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/20680-eu-army-daily-squib-accurately-predicted-todays-news-2012.html">EU Army</a> so as not create fear amongst its conquered subjects.</p>
<p>The future of Europe is one that will be fraught with conflict thanks to the aspirations of the unelected leaders of the EU who will invariably coax Russia into skirmishes along the borders. It was EU meddling in the Ukraine that finally awoke the sleeping bear, and Putin decided enough was enough. There will be more of these incidents occurring, until the Russian bear is mobilised completely, and the EU leaders will have what they want, a full conventional ground war, and more of a reason for ever closer union.</p>

<p>The foundation&#8217;s secretary, Janice Anderson, was adamant that president Trump deserved the honour of being remembered on Mount Rushmore with all of America&#8217;s other great presidents forever.</p>
<p>&#8220;President Donald Trump has brought America up again after many years of stagnation under that other guy. The economy is zooming ahead, manufacturing, exports, oil production, jobs, and low unemployment. The stock market just rises and rises beyond any levels we could have ever dreamed of, and the Democrats are dumbfounded, lost, and speechless. What Mr. Trump has done for the American people is beyond anything we have seen ever, and he&#8217;s got more, there&#8217;s more to come. The Teflon Don. What a guy? What a prez!&#8221;</p>
<p>According to tradition, the Mount Rushmore Donald Trump statue would be completed a few years after he leaves office.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have commissioned the finest sculptors from Italy to come here and complete the statue. It would take about one and a half years to complete. The sculptors have also compensated for the Don&#8217;s haircut, which would effectively make the statue 75 feet taller than the other statues, but we are sure that would be pleasing to the president.</p>
<p>&#8220;Donald Trump&#8217;s head would go next to Abraham Lincoln&#8217;s, as there is a spot there ready for crafting. Altogether, the statue will cost the US taxpayer $42 million, that&#8217;s a drop in the ocean compared to what Donald Trump has brought to America economically.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Like all the dumb Japs, they paid up and left,&#8221; Luigi Montagna, the eatery&#8217;s laughing owner told the local Venetian news.</p>
<p>To say it is dangerous to eat in Venice if you are a foreigner is an understatement. The unscrupulous restaurant owners love to rip off tourists who they think don&#8217;t know better.</p>
<p>&#8220;The tourist he say to me he want a lasagne. I slap on a teaspoon of mincemeat, half cook, then throw on a piece of lettuce over the top. He smile like it best Italian food in world. I charge him 670 euros not including tax. He leaves happy, I leave restaurant straight to my mistress, happy. We all happy, innit?&#8221; another Venetian restauranter revealed with jocularity.</p>
<p>It takes fucking balls to charge someone that amount of money for a mediocre meal and get away with it. We asked an Italian psychologist what kind of person could get away with such behaviour?</p>
<p><strong>The balls of an Italian</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Balls! Only an Italian can charge such large amounts. We have the biggest balls in the world. As a man during the day, you have to touch your balls every few minutes, you know pat them, treat them nice. This is why Italian restaurants can charge obscene amounts of money to tourists and get away with it, like nothing happened. Balls. That&#8217;s what Tony Montana said in Scarface, the only thing that give orders is Balls. Women can&#8217;t do this shit, they don&#8217;t have the balls, and they don&#8217;t have Italian balls, the biggest fucking balls in the fucking world. That&#8217;s why we drive Ferraris and Lamborghini. That&#8217;s why we shoot for goal from half way line, that&#8217;s why we can charge a Japanese tourist 750,000% over the normal asking price &#8212; Balls!&#8221; Professor of Psychology at Venice University, Gianluca Palle, revealed.</p>
<p>The Venetian Tourist Board advised all visitors to Venice to be prepared to be ripped off at all restaurants as it is an &#8220;Italian customary right to inflict ridiculous prices on tourists&#8221;.</p>
<p>In November 2017, a British tourist dubbed a Venice restaurant “horrible and disgusting” after being charged €25,526 (£22,420) for lunch for three. The tourist from Coventry ate with his parents at Trattoria Stronzo in the central San Marco district, ordering a spread of food and sharing it between them. Italian restaurants often charge by weight rather than portion, and the restaurant denied any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Venice mayor Luigi Coglione introduced fines last year of 2,000 euros to dissuade tourists from littering, walking around topless and other acts deemed inappropriate, but also said tourists “need to shell out a bit” when eating in the city, following criticisms of extortionate bills at restaurants.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to the #metoo new puritanism that is sweeping the politically correct sovietized West, there is no place sacrosanct.</p>
<p>Now that the art world and museums are being targeted worldwide by the cultureless puritans and their ISIS-like penchant for erasing history with destruction, new levels of censorship and banning are being reached daily.</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw a Roman statue of a female nymph. The statue objectifies the female form and accentuates her breasts and privates. This is disgusting. We should ban everything Roman,&#8221; one social justice warrior yelled at the British museum&#8217;s Roman section.</p>
<p>The woman was then pointed towards the Greek section of the museum where she went even more hysterical after spying a sculpture of a Greek Goddess fellating a male lion according to some myth or something.</p>
<p>Of course the sculpture of a nude woman objectifies the female form, that is what art is meant to do, it is meant to present this piece of stone, then transform it into this wonderful curvaceous objectification of the beautiful female form. It is in essence a celebration of the female. What the fuck is wrong with that? Sculptures and painters have been doing it for thousands of years.</p>
<p><strong>Celebration of Fertility</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina_and_vulva_in_art">vagina and vulva</a> have been depicted in art from prehistory to the contemporary art era of the 21st century. Visual art forms representing the female genitals encompass two-dimensional (e.g. paintings) and three-dimensional (e.g. statuettes). As long ago as 35,000 years ago, people sculpted Venus figurines that exaggerated the abdomen, hips, breasts, thighs, or vulva.</p>
<p>Feminist activist Gina Warte, has applauded an obscure Manchester art gallery &#8212; which will either hopefully be burned to the ground or attendance dropped to zero &#8212; that recently threw out a <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/art/what-to-see/manchester-art-gallerys-metoo-inspired-removal-nude-nymphs-painting/">Waterhouse painting</a> depicting some salacious nymphs coaxing a man into a pond. This pre-Raphaelite masterpiece has now been consigned to the bin thanks to the feminazi puritans.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-27240" src="https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/nymphs_wATERHOUSE-PURITAN-FEMINISTS-BAN-300x188.png" alt="nymphs_wATERHOUSE - PURITAN FEMINISTS BAN" width="620" height="388" srcset="https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/nymphs_wATERHOUSE-PURITAN-FEMINISTS-BAN-300x188.png 300w, https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/nymphs_wATERHOUSE-PURITAN-FEMINISTS-BAN-768x480.png 768w, https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/nymphs_wATERHOUSE-PURITAN-FEMINISTS-BAN-1024x640.png 1024w, https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/nymphs_wATERHOUSE-PURITAN-FEMINISTS-BAN.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;This Waterhouse painting showed a vile depiction of young women as objects in a pond asking a man to join them. In 2018 wimmin hate men and we would never ask a man to join us in the water only if we could drown the bastard. I myself have never slept with a man or had relations with a man because I have big arms, a hairy chest and my vulva looks like a pair of testicles dangling between my legs. I am therefore angry at men for rejecting me.&#8221;</p>
<p>All galleries worldwide were warned in a global poster campaign funded by shady socialist groups that they have until next week to remove all depictions of women from all galleries, especially if nude.</p>
<p>John D. Salinger, a gallery owner from New York was not amused by the anti-art, anti-female form puritanical activism that has been going around.</p>
<p>&#8220;Puritans have a choice. They can stay away from the art gallery, they can switch off, they can hide in their room, but for fuck&#8217;s sake, let us other people enjoy what we&#8217;ve been enjoying for thousands of years, i.e. the female nude body. Just go and shoot yourself in your brainwashed nazi brain.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man, Long Tam Rei Ding, 23, allegedly started reading the Daily Squib from the evening of January 27 until his friends called for an ambulance in the afternoon of January 28.</p>
<p>According to Chinese news site QQ.com, Long Tam Rei Ding was trying to go to the toilet when he realised he couldn&#8217;t move the lower part of his body at an internet cafe in Jiaxing, Zhejiang Province.</p>
<p>One of his friends, who was at the scene, was quoted as saying: &#8216;It seems he had lost sensation completely, and couldn&#8217;t move at all. The only thing he had was a huge erection that would not go down. The medic called it a priapism or something. We had to call for an ambulance.&#8217;</p>
<p>It remains unclear what article the man had been reading at the time.</p>
<p>A video shows the man&#8217;s friend and paramedics working together to move the man from a chair to a stretcher.</p>
<p>The man is reportedly under hospital observation.</p>
<p><strong>Satire Addiction</strong></p>
<p>Satire addiction has become a prominent societal issue among the young people in China, with an increasing number of young people choosing to ignore their studies, social lives and family to surf the web for quality satire.</p>
<p>Last October, a 21-year-old woman in China became blind in one eye after reading Daily Squib articles on her mobile phone non-stop for six days. She was thankfully cured after the doctor told her to read the Squib for a further six days with her remaining eye. Sadly she now cannot close her eyelids and has a permanent stare dubbed the &#8216;1000 mile Squib stare&#8217;.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>When the Conservative party is no longer conservative, when Britain is preferred to be a nation ruled by others with laws governing the UK, why not go for Jeremy Corbyn as the next inhabitant of Number 10?</p>
<p>In essence, the whole of the system has gone to pot anyway, so let us reach out for more chaos, more disorder. Let us bite the bullet in ridiculousness, in utter monstrous change that ruins Britain further, because this nation has already gone way below any viable meter, it has in fact plumbed the depths of depravity that can never be fixed ever again.</p>
<p>When we have members of the Conservative party openly deriding Britain, openly causing harm on the country and plotting its fall, and these people are applauded, they are not thrown headfirst from the Tory party, no, they are allowed to continue to create discord, to plot with Brussels, to receive payment from the nation&#8217;s enemies to hurt Britain and its interests. There is no hope in the Conservative party, and their stance on Brexit is the defining moment when the people who championed the Tories once should punish them dearly by voting and supporting Jeremy Corbyn to come to power and his high tax, unholy crusade to punish the rich, to punish the royals, and to punish the landed classes with his antithesis to capitalism, and his Soviet Marxist ideals of collectivisation.</p>
<p>Yes, the country would fall even further into debt, and multiple generations of Britons would be saddled with paying that off, but the Tories squandered their chance, especially with the unelection of Theresa May as PM.</p>
<p>It is too late, it is too far gone to say anything else other than let us unite behind the communist shisters in Momentum and their champagne socialist Islington affairs resplendent with the horrendous Marxist agenda brought upon by Comrade Corbyn.</p>
<p>Let us support the grey bearded, red socked, sandalled one who shall step over the hallowed doorstep of Number 10, Downing Street, and defile the very corridors, and rooms that Margaret Thatcher once resided.</p>
<p>The blood, crimson, bubbling with ardour and oozing from the blue stained Tories is one that has come to be poured into a bucket, and tipped gently over the head of Theresa May. She had her chance, she squandered it. Now, she and the country will be punished forever by a Corbyn win &#8212; a pure hell that will envelope the nation like a dark tumultuous curtain of death.</p>
<p>Not only will Labour condemn the nation to hell economically, but it will also turn around any EU Brexit wins, of which there are none, and soon we will all be embroiled in a euro currency, and forever servitude to the dastardly EU.</p>
<p>No one had the balls to stand up to Theresa May. Not one single Tory stood up. Not one.</p>
<p>This is why Jeremy Corbyn should be the correct punishment for the Tory apathy, and silence.</p>
<p>And as Edmund Burke once said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: left;"><strong>“The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men should do nothing.”</strong></p>

<p>Such is the watering down process by the insipid May, who has capitulated to every EU demand without even a word, that her contempt for the British people and their wishes is all too evident.</p>
<p>How Britain has fallen from once a proud nation, sailing the high seas, conquering new lands, trading worldwide, exporting their wares, and importing other products.</p>
<p>The death of Brexit ultimately means the death of democracy, from whence the vultures and crooked scum traitors sold off their country for a pittance and aided our enemies against the Crown.</p>
<p>The people of Britain are thus deemed worthless, they are mere chattel to be thrown from one place to another without say, democracy, a long forgotten memory amongst the dead eyed treasonous traitors who take backhanders from Brussels and defend their immoral ill gotten gains by backstabbing the voter.</p>
<p>Contempt for democracy, contempt for law, contempt for the will of the people, and contempt for Britain&#8217;s honour, only shame remains, shame and cowardice. The crooked have won, as Tony Blair laughs into the faces of the British people, he gains more riches off their misery, and he laughs even more, the delight of getting away with treason, getting away with all that he has done, the blood soaked membranes of dead Iraqi children moulded into each and every mansion he owns with his evil witch wife.</p>
<p>Theresa May is a cowardly grey mutt, a withering faltering non-entity who has succumbed to the EU, she has sold the British nation to the dogs, condemned us to many more years of transitionary purgatory, just as her barren womb aches for a child, she herself aches for redemption from the people who she has so callously betrayed. A stinking rotten womb black with injustice to the British people, Theresa May is a malevolent tawdry puss filled pustule that will one day burst onto her gilded mirror, a gooey reminder of what she really is, and how she cannot sleep at night any more.</p>
<p>None of them who betrayed Britain should ever be allowed to forget their crimes of treason, their abandonment of democracy and their treacherous selling of Britain to our enemies and their corpulent envelopes filled with dirty euros handed to them under tables, in dark alleys, and EU offices.</p>
<p>Betrayal of the fundamental tenets of democracy is what they have done by watering down Brexit. If one cannot hold a democratic referendum and have the result stick, what hope is there for democracy? We all know that the EU, a body of unelected officials does not value democracy, BUT BRITAIN SHOULD VALUE DEMOCRACY!</p>
<p>You cannot have a referendum and then say it was not the right answer you wanted then have another one, then another one until you get the correct answer according to your nefarious agenda? That IS NOT DEMOCRACY!</p>
<p>The people were assured that the result of the EU Referendum, held on June 23, 2016, would stand. This result was agreed to be respected by all parties, but they did not, and this is why we are here now in the year 2018, with a watered down Brexit in name only.</p>
<p>We have had enough of Theresa May. She has delayed, allowed Remainers to dictate what happens, and she has agreed to all EU terms without question.</p>
<p>Theresa May is inoperative. There is no other way than to oust this fucking turkey, and put her in the oven.</p>
<p>Get some fucking balls someone and get up, oust Theresa May right now. Decisions can be made in less than thirty seconds, do not think, ACT. You must do this right now, to save Britain from an un-democratic future under the EU.</p>
<p>This is a fight for Western Democratic rights, it is a fight for our right to make our own laws, our own sovereign national state, it is a fight for the basic tenets of δημοκρατία dēmokratía, or &#8220;rule of the people&#8221; NOT by unelected faceless Eurocrat officials from the European Commission.</p>
<h2>NO!</h2>

<p><em>Somewhere under here is the answer to the problems we are dealing with today. Can you spot the elusive solution?</em></p>
<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tVt_1ByddUQ" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center></p>
<p class="intmt"><strong>The Prime Minister (Mrs. Margaret Thatcher)</strong></p>
<p class="mt">With permission, Mr. Speaker, I shall make a statement on the European Council held in Rome on 27 and 28 October, which I attended with my right hon. Friend <span class="nm">Douglas Hurd </span>the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary. The conclusions of the Council have been placed in the Library of the House.</p>
<p>The Council had to deal in the first place with some urgent items of current business: namely, the Community&#8217;s failure to agree a negotiating position on agriculture for the Uruguay round of trade negotiations; the situation in the Gulf, and the position of the foreign nationals held hostage in Iraq and Kuwait; and the problems which have arisen in Hungary.</p>
<p>Looking further ahead, the Council also dealt with the preparations for the two intergovernmental conferences, on economic and monetary union and also on institutional reform, which are due to begin in December. I shall report on the Council&#8217;s business in that order.</p>
<p>The Uruguay round of trade negotiations is due to be completed before the end of this year. The outcome will decide whether world trade becomes steadily more open, or we repeat the mistakes of the past and relapse into protectionism.</p>
<p>The most difficult item is agriculture. All the major participants in the Uruguay round committed themselves to table negotiating offers by 15 October. All except the European Community have done so.</p>
<p>The Community has been discussing this problem since the round began in the autumn of 1986. It gave an unequivocal commitment in April last year to make substantial and progressive reductions in agricultural support. That commitment was repeated at the Houston economic summit in July this year.</p>
<p>The Commission has put forward a proposal for 30 per cent. reductions, backdated to 1986. So what has already been done by way of reduction of support since then will be set against that 30 per cent.</p>
<p>There have been six sessions of European Community Ministers to discuss the proposal. The most recent, lasting some 16 hours, was on Friday last week. But no agreement has been reached. The main opposition has come from France and Germany.</p>
<p>The Community&#8217;s failure has harmed its reputation. Negotiations between the leading groups of countries cannot start until the Community&#8217;s proposals have been tabled.</p>
<p>The European Council requested Ministers to meet again and put the Commission in a position to table a negotiating offer. The Netherlands Prime Minister suggested that the basis for this should be the position reached when Agriculture Ministers suspended their work early on 27 October. But President Mitterrand made it clear that France would continue to vote against those proposals.</p>
<p>It remains for Agriculture and Trade Ministers to try yet again to reach a conclusion. If we fail, it will give a signal to the world that the Community is protectionist.</p>
<p>Next, with regard to the Gulf and the position of the hostages, the European Council agreed a firm statement calling for Iraq&#8217;s withdrawal from Kuwait and confirming Europe&#8217;s absolute commitment to full implementation of the United Nations Security Council resolutions. The <span class="col">[column 870]</span>statement makes it clear that we shall consider further steps if Iraq does not comply. The message is that Saddam Hussein must not gain anything from his aggression.</p>
<p>The Council also strongly condemned Iraq for holding foreign nationals as hostages and for using them in an unscrupulous way. This is totally unacceptable. Moreover, Iraq is negotiating over the hostages with the purpose of trying to divide the international community. After considerable discussion, the Council affirmed our determination not to send representatives of our Governments in any capacity to negotiate with Iraq for the release of hostages, and to discourage others from doing so. I believe that the unity of the Twelve, and our determination not to allow Saddam Hussein to divide us on the question of hostages, will send a very powerful signal to Iraq.</p>
<p>The third point is assistance to Hungary. In the course of the Council, member states received appeals from the Government of Hungary for help in dealing with the serious problems that have arisen as a result of the reduction in the supply of oil from the Soviet Union. The consequent price rises have given rise to unrest. The Council issued a strong statement of support for Hungary in pursuing its path towards democratic and economic reforms and the rule of law. The Council also agreed, at the United Kingdom&#8217;s suggestion, to bring forward and disburse rapidly the second instalment of the $1 billion Community loan for Hungary which we agreed last year. This will be of direct practical assistance.</p>
<p>Those were the urgent matters on which the Council had to act. Looking further to the future, we also discussed the preparations for the two intergovernmental conferences, or IGCs, which will start their work on 14 December.</p>
<p>For the conference on political union, the Council had before it a report by Foreign Ministers listing a wide range of possible institutional changes which the intergovernmental conference might consider. Heads of Government called for further work to be done on these proposals between now and December.</p>
<p>My right hon. Friend <span class="nm">Douglas Hurd</span>the Foreign Secretary and I argued that it would be wrong to prejudge the conclusions of the intergovernmental conference. We were on strong ground, since the Community&#8217;s original decision to call the conference specified that it should set its own agenda. Nevertheless, others wished to give specific directions to the IGC. We therefore reserved the United Kingdom&#8217;s position on, for example, extension of the Community&#8217;s powers into new areas, greater powers for the European Parliament in the legislative sphere, defining European citizenship, and a common foreign and security policy. All these are issues for discussion at the intergovernmental conference itself rather than to be settled in advance.</p>
<p>On economic and monetary union, I stressed that we would be ready to move beyond the present position to the creation of a European monetary fund and a common Community currency which we have called a hard ecu. But we would not be prepared to agree to set a date for starting the next stage of economic and monetary union before there is any agreement on what that stage should comprise. And I again emphasised that we would not be prepared to have a single currency imposed upon us, nor to surrender the use of the pound sterling as our currency.</p>
<p>The hard ecu would be a parallel currency, not a single currency. If, as time went by, people and Governments chose to use it widely, it could evolve towards a single <span class="col">[column 871]</span>currency. But our national currency would remain unless a decision to abolish it were freely taken by future generations of Parliament and people. A single currency is not the policy of this Government.</p>
<p>I should like to offer four comments in conclusion.</p>
<p>First, the Community finds it more difficult to take the urgent, detailed decisions than to discuss longer-term concepts. Moreover, no one should underestimate the extent to which national interests prevail among those who most proclaim their Community credentials.</p>
<p>Secondly, Britain intends to be part of the further political, economic and monetary development of the European Community. That is what the great majority of member states want, too. When we come to negotiate on particular points, rather than concepts or generalities, I believe that solutions will be found which will enable the Community to go forward as Twelve. That will be our objective.</p>
<p>Thirdly, we are fighting in Europe for British farmers, for British consumers, for a new world trade agreement, for help to the newly democratic countries of eastern Europe, and for the interests and concerns of our people.</p>
<p>Fourthly, while we fully accept our commitments under the treaties and wish to co-operate more closely with other countries in the European Community, we are determined to retain our fundamental ability to govern ourselves through Parliament. I believe that that is the wish of this House, and we on this side will do our best to see that it is fulfilled.</p>
<p class="intnonmt"><strong>Mr. Neil Kinnock (Islwyn)</strong></p>
<p class="nonmt">I thank the right hon. Lady for that statement and welcome the summit statements on, first, the complete solidarity of the Governments of the Community countries against Saddam Hussein and, secondly, economic support for the Soviet Union, Hungary and other central and east European countries.</p>
<p>On the central matter discussed in Rome, is it not clear that last weekend the Prime Minister managed to unite the rest of the European Community against her, to divide her own party and, more importantly, further to weaken the influence that Britain needs in order properly to uphold our national interests in the European Community? Can the Prime Minister tell us why she was apparently taken by surprise by the proposals put by others in Rome? Does she not recall that in 1985 she whipped and guillotined the Single European Act through the House, in June 1989 at Madrid she formally agreed with other heads of Government to be determined to achieve the progressive realisation of economic and monetary union, and at the Dublin summit this year she agreed to intensify the process of European union in economic, monetary and political terms? Those were all steps which raised comment at the time. Did she not know what she was doing on those occasions, or was she living in cloud cuckoo land?</p>
<p>The Prime Minister says that the Government would not surrender the use of the pound sterling as our currency. Perhaps she will therefore tell us how she regards the advice of her fellow Conservative, Commissioner Brittan, when he said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“You don&#8217;t have to lose the pound sterling under the single currency plan. You can perfectly well have a note or a coin which states its value in pounds … and its fixed equivalent in ecu … It&#8217;s been agreed that that would be possible.”</p></blockquote>
<p>On the connection between currency and sovereignty, can the Prime Minister, who abandoned her own Madrid conditions before she put sterling into the exchange rate mechanism, tell the House what will be her conditions now <span class="col">[column 872]</span>for putting sterling into the narrow banding of the ERM? The Prime Minister could come to a debate and explain all these things from the Dispatch Box if she was willing to do so.</p>
<p>When the Prime Minister conducts herself as she did in Rome this weekend, is it any wonder that she cannot even get agreement for the necessary reduction in farm subsidies? <i>[Interruption.]</i> She has no influence at all. When she conducts herself as she does, is it any wonder that some members of her own party believe that she has undermined the Chancellor&#8217;s efforts to build support for the so-called hard ecu? Does she not realise that such an attitude makes the Heads of other Governments even less susceptible to listening to the sensible arguments that can be deployed in favour of sovereignty in the Community? Does she accept that it is reasonable to put the view that the determinants of the pace and direction of economic and monetary union should be the realities of economic performance and the degree of economic convergence, not arbitrary diary dates?</p>
<p>Does the Prime Minister not understand that, with her method of conducting affairs, she is throwing away that sound argument and losing both potential allies and necessary influence? Does she not appreciate that, even now, her tantrum tactics will not stop the process of change or change anything in the process of change? All they do is strand Britain in a European second division without the influence over change that we need, the financial and industrial opportunities that we need and the sovereignty that we need.</p>
<p class="intmt"><strong>The Prime Minister</strong></p>
<p class="mt">It is our purpose to retain the power and influence of this House, rather than denude it of many of its powers. I wonder what the right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s policy is, in view of some of the things that he said. Would he have agreed to a commitment to extend the Community&#8217;s powers to other supplementary sectors of economic integration without having any definition of what they are? One would have thought, from what he said, that he would. The Commission wants to extend its powers and competence into health matters, but we said no, we would not agree to that.</p>
<p>From what the right hon. Gentleman said, it sounded as though he would agree, for the sake of agreeing, and for being Little Sir Echo, and saying, “Me, too.” Would the right hon. Gentleman have agreed to extending qualified majority voting within the Council, to delegating implementing powers to the Commission, to a common security policy, all without any attempt to define or limit them? The answer is yes. He does not have a clue about the definition of some of the things that he is saying, let alone securing a definition of others.</p>
<p>We have agreed to wait to give support to the Soviet Union until the IMF report is received. That is coming at the next summit.</p>
<p>It was not we who stopped unity on agriculture—it was France and Germany. Had the right hon. Gentleman even read the statement, which he had before I came in, he would have noticed—and had he even listened to the statement when I made it, he would have known—that it was Francois Mitterrand who said that he would not agree to the Commission&#8217;s proposal. We are not to blame in any way for not reaching agreement on agriculture. But for the insistence of my right hon. Friend <span class="nm">Douglas Hurd</span>the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary and me, the chair would not even have had the matter discussed, so urgent was it that <span class="col">[column 873]</span>it should be. I told the chair over a week ago that, if the farm Ministers did not reach agreement, we must discuss the matter, and I wrote to him. He did everything that he could to see that a matter so urgent was not discussed, but we succeeded in getting it discussed.</p>
<p>As to the right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s strictures about economic and monetary union, that phrase was agreed by the European Community before we went in. It is one of those things that we inherited. It was agreed in 1972. When it came to defining it—<i>[Interruption.]</i> We went into the Community in 1973, and I had understood that most Labour Members were in favour of that. I wonder today if they are changing their stance for the sake of debating points.</p>
<p>Leon Brittan is a loyal member of the Commission. Yes, the Commission wants to increase its powers. Yes, it is a non-elected body and I do not want the Commission to increase its powers at the expense of the House, so of course we differ. The President of the Commission, Mr. Delors, said at a press conference the other day that he wanted the European Parliament to be the democratic body of the Community, he wanted the Commission to be the Executive and he wanted the Council of Ministers to be the Senate. <strong>No. No. No</strong>.</p>
<p>Perhaps the Labour party would give all those things up easily. Perhaps it would agree to a single currency and abolition of the pound sterling. Perhaps, being totally incompetent in monetary matters, it would be only too delighted to hand over full responsibility to a central bank, as it did to the IMF. The fact is that the Labour party has no competence on money and no competence on the economy—so, yes, the right hon. Gentleman would be glad to hand it all over. What is the point of trying to get elected to Parliament only to hand over sterling and the powers of this House to Europe? Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman will understand his brief a little better next time.</p>
<p class="intnonmt"><strong>Mr. Nicholas Ridley (Cirencester and Tewkesbury)</strong></p>
<p class="nonmt"><i>rose</i>——</p>
<p class="intnonmt"><strong>Hon. Members</strong></p>
<p class="nonmt">Speak for Germany.</p>
<p class="intnonmt"><strong>Mr. Speaker</strong></p>
<p class="nonmt">Order. Mr. Ridley</p>
<p class="intnonmt"><strong>Mr. Ridley</strong></p>
<p class="nonmt">May I congratulate my right hon. Friend on standing up for the interests of the people of this country and ask her whether she thinks that the eleven are not now both isolated and intransigent in relation to agricultural policy and the GATT round? Does she think that they are deliberately working for the failure of the GATT round in order to achieve their objectives of a fortress Europe? If they are, does she agree that that is not a destination for which we want to board the train?</p>
<p class="intmt"><strong>The Prime Minister</strong></p>
<p class="mt">My right hon. Friend is right. The European community is the only group of nations which, after years of studying the problem, has not tabled an initial negotiating position on agriculture in the GATT round. The United States, Japan, the Cairns group, Canada and Switzerland have tabled theirs, but from the Community—nothing. It really is a disgrace that we have not even been able to agree on a negotiating position, let alone start to negotiate with all the other groups by between now and the end of the year. <span class="col">[column 874]</span></p>
<p>Yes, I agree with my right hon. Friend that several countries in the Community are highly protectionist. The common agricultural policy is a protectionist policy, but we will try to reduce the protectionism, first because it would help the third world, secondly because it would mean that we would not have export subsidies—and thereby take business away from other countries—and thirdly because in this country we believe in open trade. This was the most serious matter to be discussed at the European Council, and I most earnestly hope that this time Agriculture Ministers—there will be no difficulty with us, but I mean the French and German Agriculture Ministers—will accept the proposals of the Commission for the negotiating position in the Uruguay round.</p>
<p class="intnonmt"><strong>Mr. Paddy Ashdown (Yeovil)</strong></p>
<p class="nonmt">Does the Prime Minister realise how welcome it was to hear in her statement that she has at last been forced to admit that the hard ecu proposal can be a transitional mechanism to a single currency? Will she congratulate the Chancellor and the Foreign Secretary on levering her forward towards reality on that matter? Does she realise that that is good news for Britain?</p>
<p>Does the right hon. Lady realise how much of her performance at Rome was bad news for Britain? Does she realise that in a single meeting she has isolated this country in Europe, weakened our voice in Europe, divided the Government and betrayed this country&#8217;s long-term best interests? Does she realise that if she faced a Labour party that was not equally divided, muddled and confused on this matter, she would today face a motion of no confidence in her failure at this historic moment? Does she realise—<i>[Interruption.]</i></p>
<p class="intnonmt"><strong>Mr. Speaker</strong></p>
<p class="nonmt">Order.</p>
<p class="intnonmt"><strong>Mr. Ashdown</strong></p>
<p class="nonmt">Does the Prime Minister realise that for as long as she hangs on to power, so long will Britain be held back from its future, and that she no longer speaks for Britain—she speaks for the past?</p>
<p class="intmt"><strong>The Prime Minister</strong></p>
<p class="mt">Oh dear, it seems that there must be quite a lot of late parrots in cloud cuckoo land, judging by the right hon. Gentleman coming out with that stuff. Of course, if there is a parallel currency and people choose to make more and more use of it, it could evolve into a single currency, but that could not be done without a decision coming back to this House and, I believe, to the people of this country. I take it that the right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s policy is to abolish the pound sterling, the greatest expression of sovereignty. In any event, it would be totally and utterly wrong to agree to that now. That matter is one to be decided by future generations and future Parliaments. Parliament is supreme, not the right hon. Gentleman the Leader of the Liberal Democrats.</p>
<p class="intnonmt"><strong>Mr. Robin Squire (Hornchurch)</strong></p>
<p class="nonmt">In the light of last weekend&#8217;s discussions, will my right hon. Friend reconsider in the near future the proposal to separate the Bank of England and make it independent so that it may serve as a buttress in this country&#8217;s battle against inflation?</p>
<p class="intmt"><strong>The Prime Minister</strong></p>
<p class="mt">Independent banks are mostly either answerable to a parliament—as in the United States, where Mr. Greenspan is answerable to Congress—or have a number of politicians on their boards. I do not believe that the structure that this country currently has would be <span class="col">[column 875]</span>served well by the proposal that my hon. Friend mentions. It is far better to increase democracy than to reduce it, which I believe would be wrong at this time.</p>
<p class="intnonmt"><strong>Mr. James Lamond (Oldham, Central and Royton)</strong></p>
<p class="nonmt">What is the point of the Prime Minister trying to wrap herself in the union jack for electoral purposes—[Hon Members: “Better that than the red flag.” ]—and then coming to the Dispatch Box to tell the House that she is prepared to sell the working people of this country down the river by opening Britain up completely to free trade without any protectionism whatsoever, destroy the multi-fibre arrangement, and give the emerging democracies in Europe £1,000 million in loans to produce goods on wages of £80 a month, so that textiles in particular will flood into this country, which would destroy hundreds of thousands of British jobs? Is that what the right hon. Lady was elected to do? Is she really protecting this country, or is she only pretending to do so?</p>
<p class="intmt"><strong>The Prime Minister</strong></p>
<p class="mt">The hon. Gentleman probably heard the comment made by some of my right hon. and hon. Friends, “Better to wrap yourself in the union jack than the red flag.” The hon. Gentleman&#8217;s remarks amount to a totally protectionist policy, which would lead to retaliation against us, reduce the capability of our export industries and therefore our standard of living, and make our industries inefficient and therefore cost the housewife a great deal more.</p>
<p>I note also that the hon. Gentleman complains about goods entering Britain from Third world countries where wages are far lower. I have heard the hon. Gentleman say several times in the House that Third world countries need help. They need trade as much as they need aid.</p>
<p class="intnonmt"><strong>Mr. Norman Tebbit (Chingford)</strong></p>
<p class="nonmt">Does my right hon. Friend agree that the mark of a single currency is not only that all other currencies must be extinguished but that the capacity of other institutions to issue currencies must also be extinguished? In the case of the United Kingdom, that would involve Parliament binding its successors in a way that it has hitherto regarded as unconstitutional.</p>
<p class="intmt"><strong>The Prime Minister</strong></p>
<p class="mt">I am grateful to my right hon. Friend. This Government have no intention of abolishing the pound sterling. If the hard ecu were to evolve and much greater use were to be made of it, that would be a decision for future Parliaments and generations. That decision could be taken only once.</p>
<p>It should not be taken in the current atmosphere, but only after the greatest possible consideration. I believe that both Parliament and sterling have served this country and the rest of the world very well. We are more stable and influential with sterling, and it is an expression of our sovereignty. This Government believe in the pound sterling.</p>
<p class="intnonmt"><strong>Mr. James Molyneaux (Lagan Valley)</strong></p>
<p class="nonmt">Does the Prime Minister recall that Britain was in a minority of one in the Europe of 1940? Does she further agree that, 50 years on, the basic issue is still the same—undiluted parliamentary democracy and not imposed diktat?</p>
<p class="intmt"><strong>The Prime Minister</strong></p>
<p class="mt">I totally agree with the right hon. Gentleman. There are some things for which there was majority voting within the Community when we went in, and we accepted that, and for the specific objective of achieving the Single European Act only, there have been <span class="col">[column 876]</span>more matters. Now there is an attempt to get far more things passed by majority voting. That means that we would have more laws imposed upon us, even if the House was flatly against them. We expect our people to obey the law, mainly because it has gone through all the legislative processes in this House, and we should be very slow to add to any majority competence on the part of the Community.</p>
<p class="intnonmt"><strong>Mr. Steve Norris (Epping Forest)</strong></p>
<p class="nonmt">Does my right hon. Friend accept that there is wide support in my constituency for the stance that she took at the intergovernmental conference on economic and monetary union? Does she further accept that that support is based not on the niceties of international economics but on the clear and firm belief that those who dictate fiscal policy to the United Kingdom should be fully and directly answerable to its electors?</p>
<p class="intmt"><strong>The Prime Minister</strong></p>
<p class="mt">I totally agree with my hon. Friend. The Delors report is proposing that those people should be answerable to no one. It is very ironic indeed that, at a time when eastern Europe is striving for greater democracy, the Commission should be striving to extinguish democracy and to put more and more power into its own hands, or into the hands of non-elected bodies.</p>
<p class="intnonmt"><strong>Ms. Joyce Quin (Gateshead, East)</strong></p>
<p class="nonmt">Is it not true that the British Government are far more reluctant than Germany, France or Italy to give economic assistance to the Soviet Union? Is the Prime Minister not aware of the political risks within the Soviet Union if we do not respond generously at this time, and of the long-term risks for British industry if other countries step in and establish aid and trading relationships with the Soviet Union before we do?</p>
<p class="intmt"><strong>The Prime Minister</strong></p>
<p class="mt">The German banks—the Deutsche bank—made a considerable loan to the Soviet Union of some DM6 billion. That had all gone within a matter of weeks. It was guaranteed by the Government of the Federal Republic, and it was all gone in a matter of weeks—used to repay debts which the Soviet Union owed to German manufacturers. That has done nothing to help the economic situation in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>When we got the request for help, we suggested that we should not consider general loans which would not help a country that was already in difficulties, but should see if we could give specific help in certain spheres—for example food processing, transport and oil exploration. We are studying that, and the International Monetary Fund is judging what it is necessary for the Soviet economy to do to get it out of its present difficulties.</p>
<p>Fortunately, between the Houston economic summit and now, the Soviet Union has had a windfall in the sense that the increasing price of oil has given it a much better balance of payments position on a much greater scale than here, so that has improved its position. We shall make up our minds when the IMF has reported.</p>
<p class="intnonmt"><strong>Mr. Cranley Onslow (Woking)</strong></p>
<p class="nonmt">If these partners of ours—France and Germany—persist in blocking the reform of the common agricultural policy in December, what useful purpose does my right hon. Friend think that the intergovernmental conference is likely to achieve?</p>
<p class="intmt"><strong>The Prime Minister</strong></p>
<p class="mt">My right hon. Friend puts his finger on it absolutely. Agriculture and trade are two <span class="col">[column 877]</span>subjects in which, as national countries, we have no competence at all as it is all negotiated through the Community. They can therefore do that—they can even do it in the Agriculture Council—by majority voting. If France and Germany stick together and refuse to have reductions in their subsidies, many of the other countries where farmers are far poorer than those in France and Germany will say, “How in the world can we agree to lower subsidies when the Community&#8217;s two sets of richest farmers will not do so?”</p>
<p>I hope that the compromise solution that the Commission hammered out with Agriculture Ministers will nevertheless go through, but that is only the start, not the end, of the negotiating position with other countries; otherwise, we shall be responsible for reducing world trade.</p>
<p class="intnonmt"><strong>Dr. David Owen (Plymouth, Devonport)</strong></p>
<p class="nonmt">Is it not perfectly clear that what was being attempted at Rome was a bounce which led only one way—to a single federal united states of Europe? Is it not vital that, in this House and across party lines, it should be possible for a Prime Minister to make it clear, if necessary, that Britain is prepared to stand alone? We should not relish it, but if we were faced with the imposition by treaty of a single currency and with a situation that prevented the enlargement of the Community to include Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia, would not Britain be entitled and right to use the veto?</p>
<p class="intmt"><strong>The Prime Minister</strong></p>
<p class="mt">I totally agree with the right hon. Gentleman. That is precisely the stance that we took. It is the stance that we have taken on many previous occasions. The European monetary system to which we belong is designed for 12 sovereign states, in co-operation with one another, to come to an exchange rate mechanism. What is being proposed now—economic and monetary union—is the back door to a federal Europe, which we totally and utterly reject. We prefer greater economic and monetary co-operation, which can be achieved by keeping our sovereignty.</p>
<p class="intnonmt"><strong>Mr. Hugh Dykes (Harrow, East)</strong></p>
<p class="nonmt">Does my right hon. Friend agree and confirm that her words today mean in effect that she would prefer to withdraw from the treaty of Rome and the Single European Act?</p>
<p class="intmt"><strong>The Prime Minister</strong></p>
<p class="mt">No. We should like to have the kind of Europe that we believe in and the Europe that we went in to join. If my hon. Friend looks back at some of the speeches, he will see that we were absolutely assured that we should not be giving up sovereignty. That was the basis upon which we went in. On 24 May 1971 <span class="nm">Edward Heath</span>the Prime Minister said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We agreed in particular that the identity of national states should be maintained in the framework of the developing Community. This means, of course, that, though the European Commission has made and will continue to make a valuable contribution, the Council of Ministers should continue to be the forum in which important decisions are taken, … It provides a clear assurance, … that joining the Community does not entail a loss of national identity or an erosion of essential national sovereignty.” —[<i>Official Report,</i> 24 May 1971; Vol. 818, c. 32–33.]</p></blockquote>
<p class="intnonmt"><strong>Mr. Nigel Spearing (Newham, South)</strong></p>
<p class="nonmt">Despite what the Prime Minister has just said, is it not clear that it is the <span class="col">[column 878]</span>wish of our partners that there should be a loss of national identity on currency? Is it not true that even the hard ecu, coupled with fixed exchange rates, would lead inexorably to economic and monetary union and to government either of bankers for bankers by bankers or to a strong political central government that would usher in a new Euro-state? If the Prime Minister is to save Britain as a self-governing nation, had she not better make that clear and galvanise the people of this country and all parties in Parliament to say a very polite no to economic and monetary union?</p>
<p class="intmt"><strong>The Prime Minister</strong></p>
<p class="mt">If I believed that, I would do just as the hon. Gentleman says, but I do not believe that his interpretation is correct. I accept that many in the Economic Community would like to have their version of economic and monetary union, which would lead to passing powers away from national Parliaments to a non-elected body—in fact, to a central board of bankers—to majority voting and to the giving of more legislative power to the European Parliament. That is their version, but it is not the version that we have accepted. The Single European Act defined economic and monetary union as “Co-operation in Economic and Monetary policy” .</p>
<p>That is all you need, in my view. The hard ecu is a proposal that does not require a central bank, which would make it an inflation-proof currency and which could be used if people chose to do so. In my view, it would not become widely used throughout the Community—<i>[Interruption.]</i>—possibly most widely used for commercial transactions. Many people would continue to prefer their own currency.</p>
<p>Therefore, I do not believe that the fears of the hon. Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing) will happen. I am pretty certain that most people in this country would prefer to continue to use sterling. If, by their choice, I was wrong, there would come a time when we would have to address the question. However, that would not be for us but for future generations in the House.</p>
<p class="intnonmt"><strong>Mr. Terence Higgins (Worthing)</strong></p>
<p class="nonmt">Will my right hon. Friend take time between now and the conference in December to explain to her European colleagues what any first-year economic student could tell them, which is that the imposition of a single currency, as opposed to a common currency, would rule out for all time the most effective means of adjusting for national differences in costs and prices? Will she explain that that in turn would cause widespread unemployment, which would probably exist on a perpetual basis, and very serious financial imbalances?</p>
<p class="intmt"><strong>The Prime Minister</strong></p>
<p class="mt">Yes, I agree entirely with my right hon. Friend. It would do just that. It would also mean that there would have to be enormous transfers of money from one country to another. It would cost us a great deal of money. One reason why some of the poorer countries want it is that they would get those big transfers of money. We are trying to contest that. If we have a single currency or a locked currency, the differences come out substantially in unemployment or vast movements of people from one country to another. Many people who talk about a single currency have never considered its full implications.</p>
<p class="intnonmt"><strong>Mr. Jim Sillars (Glasgow, Govan)</strong></p>
<p class="nonmt">Will the Prime Minister ignore the advice of the right hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Dr. Owen), who talked about the British state standing alone? Will she bear in mind her humiliating experience when she was forced into the ERM <span class="col">[column 879]</span>against all her instincts and her declaration in Madrid? Is the Prime Minister aware that many people in Europe, not only in the United Kingdom, are aware of the formidable economic, political and social problems inherent in stage 2 and moving to a single currency? Does she not think that she would have a far better chance of getting people to talk about a sensible and cautious approach if, in addressing her colleagues in Europe, she used the moderate language of a 21st-century European and not the intemperate language of a little Englander?</p>
<p class="intmt"><strong>The Prime Minister</strong></p>
<p class="mt">Bearing in mind that the hon. Gentleman was not there, will he tell me of any language that was intemperate? Those who seem to know most about this are the people who were not there and heard nothing of what was said or of the way in which it was done. Radio and television broadcasts are outside and after the finish of the conference.</p>
<p>We have always said that we would join the exchange rate mechanism when the time was right. That was part of our going into the European monetary system, to which we have belonged for many years. We have put some of our reserves with the European monetary system and have the usual swap arrangements that that entails. The completion of the European monetary system is the exchange rate mechanism. All that can be done by nation states co-operating with one another. We do not need to have a federal structure at all.</p>
<p>The time came when most of the other countries had abolished their foreign exchange controls and we had led them, way ahead. Yes, I think that it was we and Germany who were isolated in that we got rid of foreign exchange controls first. The others followed, but Spain still has not done so. When they had done that, and when we adjudged that the time was right—I think that every figure that has come out since has indicated that we were right in our timing of joining the ERM and in reducing the interest rate—we completed our obligation to join. That does not mean that we agree with the next stage, which is a totally different definition of economic and monetary union.</p>
<p class="intnonmt"><strong>Mr. Anthony Nelson (Chichester)</strong></p>
<p class="nonmt">Does my right hon. Friend agree that the prospects for the British people enjoying a higher standard of living and sharing in greater prosperity will depend in no small part on securing a currency that is strong and stable—something that has dogged us in the post-war years? Is that not more likely to be achieved if we have a common currency based on the great economies of Western Europe rather than relying on our going it alone?</p>
<p class="intmt"><strong>The Prime Minister</strong></p>
<p class="mt">No, I think that many of my colleagues in Europe—in our European Council and certainly in the Finance Council—will say that there is no way in which there can be a single currency until all economies are at the same state of development, the same state of prosperity and in a Europe with one economy right across it. I do not think that there is any possibility of that stage being reached for a very long time. To take a single currency long before that has happened would be to weaken it and not to strengthen it. We will have a stronger sterling, with all its history. Many securities and contracts are denominated in sterling. We shall trade better with the great history behind sterling than we possibly could with a single currency.</p>
<p><span class="col">[column 880]</span></p>
<p class="intnonmt"><strong>Mr. Ron Leighton (Newham, North-East)</strong></p>
<p class="nonmt">There is no majority in the House for EMU, but is the Prime Minister aware that I attended a conference in Italy last year at which an Italian Minister spoke to me about EMU? I said, “What if Mrs. Thatcher opposes it?” Ungallantly, he laughed out loud and said, “We have met Mrs. Thatcher many times—she squawks and makes a noise at the beginning but always comes round and gives way in the end.” What assurances and guarantees can the Prime Minister give the House that she will not give way on this issue, as she gave way on the Madrid condition about British inflation before joining the ERM?</p>
<p class="intmt"><strong>The Prime Minister</strong></p>
<p class="mt">That is what they said when I was negotiating for a better budget deal for Britain. Twice, the people in the Commission—our people in the Commission and the presidency of the Commission—advised me to give way. They found out differently.</p>
<p class="intnonmt"><strong>Mr. Paul Channon (Southend, West)</strong></p>
<p class="nonmt">Does my right hon. Friend agree——</p>
<p class="intnonmt"><strong>Hon. Members</strong></p>
<p class="nonmt">We cannot hear.</p>
<p class="intnonmt"><strong>Mr. Speaker</strong></p>
<p class="nonmt">Order. Hon. Members are not alone in that.</p>
<p class="intnonmt"><strong>Mr. Channon</strong></p>
<p class="nonmt">Does my right hon. Friend agree that there is a grave risk that unless the Community can get its negotiating position together the GATT round of talks may collapse in the next few months? If that happens, it would be no dry, academic exercise but would mean higher costs for consumers in many countries in the next few years. Does my right hon. Friend agree that the Community&#8217;s compromise proposals on agriculture, which have been rejected, are ludicrously modest? Will she urge our colleagues in the Community to try to reach a solution—if not now, at least during the next IGC?</p>
<p class="intmt"><strong>The Prime Minister</strong></p>
<p class="mt">I agree with my right hon. Friend. If we do not reach a solution in Geneva in the Uruguay round, it will mean retaliation against us, and people&#8217;s worst fears—that the Economic Community is nothing but a fortress Europe and a protectionist club—will be realised. If we did not get a result on the agriculture round, it would not be our fault but the fault of France and Germany. There are certain protectionist elements in France, as my right hon. Friend knows. Even when we get our own negotiating position, as I hope that we shall within a week, I hope that it will be on the basis that we have been negotiating for six previous meetings. We still have to have negotiations on the other proposals that we put up with all the countries. There is still a tough way to go before we get a conclusion, but the important thing—important for the welfare of all our people—is that that round meets with success.</p>
<p class="intnonmt"><strong>Mr. Jack Ashley (Stoke-on-Trent, South)</strong></p>
<p class="nonmt">A single European currency means loss of control over our monetary policy. Our monetary policy has been an absolute shambles, so what is the Prime Minister fussing about?</p>
<p class="intmt"><strong>The Prime Minister</strong></p>
<p class="mt">Monetary policy was in its greatest shambles under Labour, when inflation reached 27 per cent.</p>
<p class="intnonmt"><strong>Sir Richard Body (Holland with Boston)</strong></p>
<p class="nonmt">Will my right hon. Friend make it clear that, if the procrastination about export subsidies by the European Community on surplus <span class="col">[column 881]</span>food continues, with the result that the Uruguay round collapses and the United States then resorts to a protectionist policy in self-defence, the one country in the EC that will suffer will be the United Kingdom?</p>
<p class="intmt"><strong>The Prime Minister</strong></p>
<p class="mt">As my hon. Friend knows, we always try for open trading. We also try to defend our farmers to see that they get a fair deal because, mostly, the subsidies in Europe go to the smaller farmers. By subsidising the smaller farmers, the efficiency of the larger family farm is undercut. We will do everything that we can to ensure that the picture that my hon. Friend has painted does not come about.</p>
<p class="intnonmt"><strong>Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones(Ynys Môn)</strong></p>
<p class="nonmt">Does the Prime Minister agree that her isolation at the Rome summit will seriously damage Wales&#8217;s prospects of benefiting under the single market, and from the exports and investment opportunities that will arise? Does she also agree that Wales, which is on the periphery of Europe, needs to be at the heart of the decision-making process in Europe and that a positive approach to Europe is needed? Does not her isolationist stance prove that Wales needs direct representation in the Community institutions?</p>
<p class="intmt"><strong>The Prime Minister</strong></p>
<p class="mt">The hon. Gentleman&#8217;s strictures would have been better directed to France and Germany, which have taken an isolationist stance on agricultural subsidies for three years. It would have been very much better if they had come along with the rest instead of sticking out for their own farmers against the good of the EC as a whole. It was those countries which were isolated on that most urgent matter.</p>
<p>As for investment, Wales—like the rest of the United Kingdom—has benefited enormously from the economic policies of this Government. We have brought in tons and tons of investment from overseas to Wales, to Scotland and to the north of England, greatly to the benefit of jobs here. People have great confidence in this Government, which is why they invest in Britain. What a pity the hon. Gentleman cannot speak up a little more for his own country.</p>
<p class="intnonmt"><strong>Mr. Tony Favell (Stockport)</strong></p>
<p class="nonmt">Next Wednesday, the doors of this Chamber will be closed to Black Rod as a symbol of the independence of this House. What would be the effect on the independence of this House and on the nation that elects it if the power to veto proposals affecting social affairs, the environment and taxation were to be removed?</p>
<p class="intmt"><strong>The Prime Minister</strong></p>
<p class="mt">I hope that, when the next election comes, people who want to come to the House will come to uphold its powers and its responsibilities, and not to denude the House of them. We have surrendered some of them to the Community, and in my view we have surrendered enough.</p>
<p class="intnonmt"><strong>Mr. Tony Benn (Chesterfield)</strong></p>
<p class="nonmt">Is the Prime Minister aware that what we are really discussing is not economic management, but the whole future of relations between this country and Europe? This issue is not best expressed in 19th-century patriotic language or in emotive language about which design is on the currency. The real question is whether, when the British people vote in a general election, they will be able to change the policies of the <span class="col">[column 882]</span>previous Government. It is already a fact, as the House knows full well, that whatever Government are in power, our agricultural policy is controlled from Brussels, our trade policy is controlled from Brussels and our industrial policy is controlled from Brussels. If we go into EMU, our financial policy will also be controlled. It is a democratic argument, not a nationalistic argument.</p>
<p>However, given that the right hon. Lady is a member of the Government who took us into the European Community without consulting the British people, given that she was Prime Minister in the Government who agreed to the Single European Act without consulting the British people, and given that she has now agreed to joining the exchange rate mechanism without consulting the British people, we find it hard to believe that she is really intent on preserving democracy rather than gaining political advantage by waving some national argument around on the eve of a general election. That is why we do not trust her judgment on the matter.</p>
<p class="intmt"><strong>The Prime Minister</strong></p>
<p class="mt">I think that I would put it just a little differently from the right hon. Gentleman, although I recognise some of the force of some of the points that he makes. When the Delors proposals for economic and monetary union came out, it was said immediately by my right hon. Friend <span class="nm">Nigel Lawson </span>the then Chancellor of the Exchequer that this was not really about monetary policy at all but about a back door to a federal Europe, taking many democratic powers away from democratically elected bodies and giving them to non-elected bodies. I believe fervently that that is true, which is why I shall have nothing to do with their definition of economic and monetary union.</p>
<p>We shall continue the co-operation that we have come to establish, as nation states. The Act that enabled us to go into Europe was passed on Second Reading by eight votes and it was made very clear then that we would not surrender our national identity, that it was a matter of co-operation. It was on the strength of that that many people went in. I am afraid that it would be quite different if we went for a single European currency and a central bank and for their definition of economic and monetary union.</p>
<p class="intnonmt"><strong>Mr. Churchill (Davyhulme)</strong></p>
<p class="nonmt">Will my right hon. Friend tell the House how far she believes that, when the moment comes, Germany will be prepared to see the transfer of its monetary policy from the Bundesbank to a European central bank on which it will have one voice out of 12?</p>
<p class="intmt"><strong>The Prime Minister</strong></p>
<p class="mt">I think that it is wrong to think that all the Twelve have similar votes or influence in these matters. I think that some in Germany—only some—are backing the scheme because they know that the dominant voice, the predominant voice, on any central bank would be the German voice. If we did not retain our national identities in Europe, the dominant people in Europe would be German. The way to balance out the different views of Europe, as we have traditionally done throughout history, is by retaining our national identity.</p>
<p class="intnonmt"><strong>Mr. Andrew Faulds (Warley, East)</strong></p>
<p class="nonmt">In view of the imminent deaths of thousands of young men—Arab, European and American—would it not be more compassionate and realistic of the Prime Minister to abandon her adamant refusal even to contemplate a negotiated solution to the Gulf crisis?</p>
<p><span class="col">[column 883]</span></p>
<p class="intmt"><strong>The Prime Minister</strong></p>
<p class="mt">I have not noticed much compassion about Saddam Hussein in Kuwait, about the way in which our hostages, our embassies or the nationals in Kuwait have been treated. There is nothing to negotiate about.</p>
<p class="intnonmt"><strong>Mr. Faulds</strong></p>
<p class="nonmt">There is everything to negotiate about, you stupid woman——</p>
<p class="intnonmt"><strong>Mr. Speaker</strong></p>
<p class="nonmt">Order.</p>
<p class="intnonmt"><strong>Mr. Faulds</strong></p>
<p class="nonmt">You stupid, negative woman.</p>
<p class="intmt"><strong>The Prime Minister</strong></p>
<p class="mt">I seem to smell the stench of appeasement in the air—the rather nauseating stench of appeasement.</p>
<p>The United Nations has clearly said that Iraq must come out of Kuwait——</p>
<p class="intnonmt"><strong>Mr. Faulds</strong></p>
<p class="nonmt">Have your war. You would love a war. You love war.</p>
<p class="intnonmt"><strong>Mr. Speaker</strong></p>
<p class="nonmt">Order. That is very bad behaviour from the hon. Gentleman. He has asked a question and he is getting the answer. He may not like it, but he must not shout in that way.</p>
<p class="intmt"><strong>The Prime Minister</strong></p>
<p class="mt">Saddam Hussein started a war, and it continues day after day with the killing, murder, torture and brutal treatment of people. Some people—and most Members of the House—have the guts to stand up to him.</p>
<p class="intnonmt"><strong>Mr. Geoffrey Dickens (Littleborough and Saddleworth)</strong></p>
<p class="nonmt">Prime Minister, may I ask you why you have been so modest this afternoon? In the past, have you not stood alone on European matters and been proved right? I am thinking of United Kingdom contributions, of the reform of the common agricultural policy, of mortgage cartels and of exchange controls. Each time, Prime Minister, you have been right. Why should the House not trust you today?</p>
<p class="intmt"><strong>The Prime Minister</strong></p>
<p class="mt">May I thank my knight in shining armour? I could not have put it better myself.</p>
<p class="intnonmt"><strong>Mr. Dave Nellist (Coventry, South-East)</strong></p>
<p class="nonmt">When preparing the statement on the Gulf that the Prime Minister has said was agreed in Rome, was the right hon. Lady aware of the existence of publicly available estimates by American chiefs of staff that within 12 days of combat there would be 30,000 allied casualties, and that 10,000 of them would be fatalities? If she disagrees with the American estimates, can she tell us what estimates have been made by the British chiefs of staff?</p>
<p class="intmt"><strong>The Prime Minister</strong></p>
<p class="mt">I remember when this country had to send forces down to the Falklands. Chiefs of staff were frequently asked what were their estimates of casualties. No one can make such an estimate.</p>
<p class="intnonmt"><strong>Mr. Nellist</strong></p>
<p class="nonmt">The Americans have.</p>
<p class="intmt"><strong>The Prime Minister</strong></p>
<p class="mt">No one can make such an estimate. There are people who can guess, but those guesses have turned out before to be very wide of the mark. It is not a question that I ask, because I know the impossibility of answering it.</p>
<p class="intnonmt"><strong>Mr. Jonathan Aitken (Thanet, South)</strong></p>
<p class="nonmt">May I congratulate my right hon. Friend on the valiant stand that she has been taking to fight for Britain&#8217;s economic and <span class="col">[column 884]</span>parliamentary independence in Europe? Will she emphasise that standing apart from the eleven&#8217;s plans for European monetary union may bring positive economic benefits to Britain? Does she agree that the country with the strongest currency, one of the highest per capita incomes and one of the strongest financial services industries in Europe, is economically and politically independent Switzerland? Does she also agree, therefore, that economic independence is no barrier to economic success?</p>
<p class="intmt"><strong>The Prime Minister</strong></p>
<p class="mt">I entirely agree. Switzerland has a marvellous record on currency, manufacturing and services, and we too shall continue to do so if others go for a single currency and we stay outside.</p>
<p class="intnonmt"><strong>Mr. Giles Radice (Durham, North)</strong></p>
<p class="nonmt">The right hon. Lady has referred to the 11 other European leaders as living in cloud cuckoo land. Has it not occurred to her that she may be living in cloud cuckoo land if she thinks that the majority of the British people are likely to go along with her short-sighted proposals on economic and monetary union, which are likely to lead to Britain&#8217;s being excluded from Europe&#8217;s first division?</p>
<p class="intmt"><strong>The Prime Minister</strong></p>
<p class="mt">No, I think that that is totally wrong. I note that the hon. Gentleman believes in a single currency regardless of the many consequences that it would have for this country—regardless of how much we would have to transfer, and regardless of the enormous consequences for our securities. I do not believe that his view is shared by many of the people.</p>
<p class="intnonmt"><strong>Mr. Radice</strong></p>
<p class="nonmt">We shall see.</p>
<p class="intmt"><strong>The Prime Minister</strong></p>
<p class="mt">Indeed we shall, but I think that the hon. Gentleman will find that most people prefer to have the pound sterling and our Parliament. If he does not wish to have either, why does he want to come here after the next election?</p>
<p class="intnonmt"><strong>Mr. Jacques Arnold (Gravesham)</strong></p>
<p class="nonmt">Will my right hon. Friend continue to bear in mind that the success of the Uruguay round and the GATT is vital to the economies of the new democracies in Latin America and the third world? Does she not agree that fine words in Rome butter no tortillas?</p>
<p class="intmt"><strong>The Prime Minister</strong></p>
<p class="mt">I agree. We can always talk about the generalities. When it came to getting down to a detailed negotiation, they did not even want to address the subject there. They ran away from it. They then said that they should set a stage 2 without having decided on its contents. We do not know what we are going to do in stage 2 yet, but they have set a date for it. That is very different from what Delors said in his report, when he stated clearly:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The conditions for moving from stage to stage cannot be defined precisely in advance: nor is it possible to foresee today when these conditions will be realised. The setting of explicit deadlines is therefore not advisable.”</p></blockquote>
<p>What a pity he did not stick to that advice, but tried to change it at the last meeting in Rome.</p>
<p class="intnonmt"><strong>Ms. Diane Abbott (Hackney, North and Stock Newington)</strong></p>
<p class="nonmt">On the question of hostages, will the Prime Minister accept that many hundreds of families in this country, including my constituent Mrs. Maggie Ross, whose husband Alistair has been held hostage at a military installation for three months, will have listened with great care to what she said, and in particular to what she said <span class="col">[column 885]</span>about there being no question of negotiation? Many of those families will have been bitterly disappointed because, although they may understand her reasons, many of them fear that, where military adventurism is concerned, the lives of the hostages are expendable.</p>
<p class="intmt"><strong>The Prime Minister</strong></p>
<p class="mt">I always understand people&#8217;s anxiety about relatives who are hostages. In my constituency I have perhaps been fortunate in that we were able to welcome home again a young girl aged 12. Of course one understands that anxiety. However, if we were to take it that we could never take action against a brutal dictator because he held hostages, we should never take action against such a dictator and he would be free to continue his ways. He would always take a few more hostages to prevent justice being done and to prevent territory and people&#8217;s homes being recovered.</p>
<p class="intnonmt"><strong>Mr. Michael Grylls (Surrey, North-West)</strong></p>
<p class="nonmt">Would not my right hon. Friend agree that the prosperity of all the people within the European Economic Community is more likely to be achieved by the successful achievement of a single market without barriers than by dreaming dreams of a federal Europe, as the right hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Dr. Owen) so courageously said earlier this afternoon? Will my right hon. Friend never stop reminding her colleagues in Europe that Britain has actually implemented more of the single market measures than any other country and that we have therefore been the best proponents of prosperity in Europe?</p>
<p class="intmt"><strong>The Prime Minister</strong></p>
<p class="mt">I agree with my hon. Friend. Part of the reason for founding the treaty of Rome was not only to bring down barriers within the six countries which joined it at the time, but to be an example to the rest of the world to bring down barriers without as well, so that we should genuinely have much freer trade and a much freer flow of trade to the benefit of trading countries and also to third world countries.</p>
<p>It is therefore vital that we complete the single market and the Uruguay round. We have got on fairly well with the directives. My hon. Friend&#8217;s recollection is correct. We and Denmark have not only passed the directives but have implemented most of them. We have only 15 or 16 to implement, while Denmark has 15. As I have said, the record of the rest of the Community varies very much in spite of the grand words. When it comes to the practical deeds, they do not match up to the grand words. The chair was taken by Italy and Italy has yet to implement 62 directives. Perhaps that explains why we went to grand words and not to specific practical suggestions.</p>
<p class="intnonmt"><strong>Mr. Stuart Bell (Middlesbrough)</strong></p>
<p class="nonmt">In one of the emollient passages of her statement earlier, the Prime Minister said that she believed that solutions could be found for the Community so that it could advance as 12. As the Prime Minister is aware, changes to the treaty are required in order to advance monetary and economic union. Those amendments to the treaty will come forward at the intergovernmental conferences in December. Is she now telling the House that she will not be using her veto power at those conferences?</p>
<p class="intmt"><strong>The Prime Minister</strong></p>
<p class="mt">We have been through one intergovernmental conference before. That was the one which led to the Single European Act, which the hon. <span class="col">[column 886]</span>Gentleman will recall. It started up with very grandiose and rather vague designs. It finished up as a very much more modest document which we were able to sign up to. I believe that that is what will happen in the intergovernmental conferences here. Many, when they look more closely at it, will not want to have a single currency unless they can have enormous transfers of money, and I do not think that those would be forthcoming.</p>
<p>Many will look at some of the other divestment of powers and not want to do that. Undoubtedly, there are some who are prepared to divest their powers and put them over to someone else. They would prefer not necessarily to have the responsibility for some of the difficult things that have to be done. I believe that most of the nation states would prefer to keep their nationality and their national identity. Therefore, there will be a great deal of negotiating. As the hon. Gentleman said, we can have a new treaty only if all Parliaments ratify it.</p>
<p class="intnonmt"><strong>Mr. John Browne (Winchester)</strong></p>
<p class="nonmt">Does my right hon. Friend accept that a single European currency is not a soft option but a harsh option and that the introduction of a single currency, without first achieving a single European market and then a single European economy, would be an extremely harsh option? Does my right hon. Friend accept also that it would benefit neither the consumer nor the producer fairly but merely the bureaucrat, and therefore lead us down a trail towards not only a federal Europe but an undemocratic, bureaucratic federal Europe?</p>
<p class="intmt"><strong>The Prime Minister</strong></p>
<p class="mt">I agree wholly with what my hon. Friend has said. When the discussions about the currency and the economic and monetary union get to the Finance Ministers, they will be very much more practical than some of the Heads of Government are about these matters. I am sure that our colleagues will have heard my right hon. Friend <span class="nm">John Major</span>the Chancellor say many times that many of his colleagues are very worried about any suggestion of a single currency before we have almost a common economy or an economy with about similar prosperity. It just would not work. Once one goes to a single currency, all th, e differences would come out in heavy unemployment and in massive movements of people. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Socialist countries such as France already have much heavier unemployment than we have. All the differences will come out in even heavier unemployment and massive movements of people from where they had previously been living to where they work.</p>
<p class="intnonmt"><strong>Mr. Ron Brown (Edinburgh, Leith)</strong></p>
<p class="nonmt">Since today the Prime Minister is a great advocate of democracy, will she allow service men and service women the democratic right to join a trade union? If she agrees with that right, she will find that service men and service women in the Gulf would vote against war in that area because they believe in negotiation rather than confrontation.</p>
<p class="intmt"><strong>The Prime Minister</strong></p>
<p class="mt">No, our present arrangements have served this country supremely well.</p>
<p class="intnonmt"><strong>Mr. Robert Hicks (Cornwall, South-East)</strong></p>
<p class="nonmt">Does my right hon. Friend agree that in the past 20 years or so many people, particularly young people, have been persuaded to support the Conservative party instead of the Labour party because of our commitment to Europe? In that context, does my right hon. Friend agree that there is increasing sadness among those people about this <span class="col">[column 887]</span>country&#8217;s apparent inability to respond in a positive manner to any proposals involving political and financial convergence and environmental issues?</p>
<p class="intmt"><strong>The Prime Minister</strong></p>
<p class="mt">On environmental issues, my hon. Friend will see that we reached agreement yesterday, and he will find that 95 per cent. of our rivers are rated good or fair, which is better than any other European country&#8217;s record. We have a programme for looking after our beaches and also for improving the quality of water—about £28 billion. We are the only country with such a programme. My hon. Friend will find many places in Europe which have nothing like the quality of water that we have.</p>
<p>My hon. Friend will find also that the question is not whether we are Europeans and key Europeans, as we are, but what sort of Europe we want—that is, whether we want a democratically responsible Europe, or whether we want a Europe of nation states which freely co-operate together. That is every bit as honourable and worthy an objective as trying to make it less democratic and trying to dissolve one&#8217;s natural loyalties to one&#8217;s country.</p>
<p class="intnonmt"><strong>Mr. David Winnick (Walsall, North)</strong></p>
<p class="nonmt">Is it not true that, on Europe, the Prime Minister is in the minority in the Cabinet and is not so much the leader of the Tory party on these issues as the leader of one of its many factions? On the Gulf, does the Prime Minister agree that all those who talk about attempts to resolve conflicts and difficulties arising from the invasion of Kuwait by negotiation, surely what has been demonstrated over the past weekend is that all the efforts of the Soviet representative in his mission to Iraq to try to persuade the dictator to give concessions have totally failed? There is not the slightest sign that Saddam Hussein intends to withdraw from Kuwait. Why should one of the most notorious of all dictators, who has committed a criminal act in the invasion of Kuwait and who has committed untold crimes and atrocities in Kuwait since 2 August, be allowed to get away with it?</p>
<p class="intmt"><strong>The Prime Minister</strong></p>
<p class="mt">Precisely—but perhaps the hon. Gentleman had better address that question to the hon. Member for Warley, East (Mr. Faulds).</p>
<p class="intnonmt"><strong>Several Hon. Members</strong></p>
<p class="nonmt"><i>rose</i>——</p>
<p class="intnonmt"><strong>Mr. Speaker</strong></p>
<p class="nonmt">Order. We have a very heavy day ahead of us. I shall allow three more questions from each side. I regret that we must then move on.</p>
<p class="intnonmt"><strong>Sir Ian Lloyd (Havant)</strong></p>
<p class="nonmt">Many hon. Members and, I suspect, many people in Europe will have the most profound respect for the discipline and informed pragmatism that the Prime Minister brings to the discussion of these matters. Does she agree that there is a great danger that the vision of a united Europe bequeathed to us by the great founders, including Winston Churchill, whom I believe was a federalist, could be at best blurred and at worst damaged if, in contemplating the complex, difficult procedures of integrating Europe we dare not consider at any stage any change, however small and however slowly achieved, in the balance of powers between this House and the European Parliament?</p>
<p class="intmt"><strong>The Prime Minister</strong></p>
<p class="mt">That is not quite correct. We went in on the basis that was clearly set out—that we were in fact not in any way going to lose our national identity and—if my hon. Friend looks back over the debate, nor would any strong national interest be overriden. That was the <span class="col">[column 888]</span>fundamental basis on which we got a majority of eight for the Second Reading of the Bill which took us into the Community. I believe that that was a very honourable way to go about it, and I believe that it is a very honourable objective to keep our national identity and have co-operation.</p>
<p>When it came to things like wanting a single market, if we were to get some of the directives through, we had to get a little bit more majority voting. That particular batch of majority voting under that single European Act, should cease when we have the single European market. Apart from that, it is better if we go forward by agreement between us all, because we have to get agreement anyway for changing the treaty. As my hon. Friend knows, we have recently completed the European monetary system by joining the exchange rate mechanism. That is for us an extra discipline for keeping down inflation, and it is also very welcome in Europe.</p>
<p class="intnonmt"><strong>Mrs. Alice Mahon (Halifax)</strong></p>
<p class="nonmt">During her discussions on the Gulf when, presumably, the Prime Minister was pressing for the Baghdad leadership to pay compensation for war crimes in the destruction of Kuwait, did the Prime Minister make any proposals to recompense the victims of the other illegal occupation in the middle east—that of the West Bank and Gaza? In her concern—I paraphrase the Prime Minister—for the unity of the international community on United Nations decisions, did she press the case of the Palestinians for decades have been having their land stolen, their homes demolished and their citizens killed? Why is Kuwaiti blood more precious than Palestinian blood? Is it because it is tinged with oil?</p>
<p class="intmt"><strong>The Prime Minister</strong></p>
<p class="mt">The hon. Lady will be aware that both situations are extremely serious and that both are very different. Kuwait had never threatened to attack or attacked anyone. She wanted only to live in peace. Unfortunately, Jordan attacked Israel. I think that she was begged not to, but she did, and that finished up by Jordan losing part of Jerusalem and losing the West Bank. The West Bank is not annexed to Israel. It has been the subject of many United Nations resolutions, some of which the Arab world did not accept for a long time, but which have been accepted more recently, in the past two years, by the Palestinians and Mr. Arafat. We have been working together, as has the Community for years, from the Venice declaration, to try to find a solution to that problem. It is not easy. It is easier to talk about it than to find a solution on the basis of resolution 242, but we continue to do so.</p>
<p>If the hon. Lady looks at the communiqué, she will see that we discussed this matter and that we are taking forward our previous policies. When this matter is settled and when Kuwait has been restored to the people of Kuwait, we shall continue to go ahead on the basis of our previous policy, which is negotiation. We have previously said that we would be in favour of an international conference so that the previous policies could be taken forward.</p>
<p class="intnonmt"><strong>Mr. William Cash (Stafford)</strong></p>
<p class="nonmt">Does my right hon. Friend accept that many people both here and elsewhere in Europe are concerned about the predominance of Germany in the European Community, but that the answer does not lie in a federal Europe because the majority voting system already contains Germany, and to move down the federal route and to go for a central bank would do no more than ensure that that central bank was <span class="col">[column 889]</span>dominated by the economic realities and the strength of the deutschmark? Does my right hon. Friend agree that we are far better off making sure that we have a wider Europe in which we have a balance of interests, including people from east, west and central Europe?</p>
<p class="intmt"><strong>The Prime Minister</strong></p>
<p class="mt">I am totally against a federal Europe and believe that the overwhelming majority of people in this country are against a federal Europe. We should not take any steps in that direction, but should uphold co-operation between our peoples. Of course, Germany will continue to be a very important country in the Community. Chancellor Kohl is always very European in his approach and very generous in his help to the eastern European countries. It is better that we negotiate with Germany as it is now and with the United Kingdom as we are now and that we do not try to have a kind of united states of Europe. It is one thing to have a United States of America from a newly settled country, but it is a different thing for ancient nation states, each with its own traditions.</p>
<p class="intnonmt"><strong>Mr. John D. Taylor (Strangford)</strong></p>
<p class="nonmt">Although the Ulster Unionist parliamentary party sits at present on the Opposition side of the House, is the Prime Minister aware that we are shocked at the somersault of policy that has taken place in the British Labour party, which is now prepared to sacrifice the democratic rights of the British people and to accept instead economic policies that are imposed by a bureaucracy based outside this country? In her statement the Prime Minister said that the Government&#8217;s policy was to oppose a single currency, but I notice that she is now qualifying that with a new adjective and referring to an “imposed” single currency. Has the Prime Minister really shifted her position slightly, and is she now saying that she is prepared to negotiate for an agreed single currency? The matter needs to be clarified.</p>
<p class="intmt"><strong>The Prime Minister</strong></p>
<p class="mt">If the right hon. Gentleman looks at our debate, he will find that it was clearly spelled out that we have proposed a hard ecu, which will be inflation-proofed, and that that is a parallel or common currency and not a single currency. However, by choice, if people used it, it could evolve into a single currency. Before any single currency comes about, it would be for future Parliaments and future generations to decide if they wished to abolish the national currency. This Government are against a single currency, but it is not for us to bind our successors in 20 or 30 years&#8217; time.</p>
<p class="intnonmt"><strong>Mr. Alan Haselhurst (Saffron Walden)</strong></p>
<p class="nonmt">What evidence does my right hon. Friend have that the bulk of industry and business, upon the success of which our national livelihood depends, is in any way reluctant to see the ordered emergence of a single currency as a logical consequence to the completion of the single market?</p>
<p class="intmt"><strong>The Prime Minister</strong></p>
<p class="mt">A single market and a single currency are two totally different things, as a short study of them would reveal. Some of the great manufacturing nations, such as Japan, the United States and Switzerland, do not have a common or a single currency with anyone else. They have a single currency of their own, and that does not hinder or affect their manufacturing position. Neither does it affect our position as the greatest financial <span class="col">[column 890]</span>centre in Europe that we are not like the yen, but we are sterling and that we are not like the dollar, but we are sterling. We trade in them all.</p>
<p class="intnonmt"><strong>Mr. Gavin Strang (Edinburgh, East)</strong></p>
<p class="nonmt">Surely the Prime Minister understands that virtually every Member of the House of Commons agrees about the absolute necessity of securing Iraq&#8217;s withdrawal from Kuwait. Does she agree that the unanimous Council declaration on the Gulf crisis, with its references to “a peaceful solution” and to the importance of maintaining consensus in the United Nations Security Council is to be warmly welcomed? Is it not clear from the declaration that the Governments of the European Community would not support early military action led by the United States? Can the right hon. Lady therefore give us the assurance that the Government&#8217;s policy will be consistent with that declaration and that they will give mandatory economic sanctions proper time to work?</p>
<p class="intmt"><strong>The Prime Minister</strong></p>
<p class="mt">This matter was dealt with when we debated it in the House. We do not believe in letting any aggressor know what action we propose to take or when. We already have full legal authority under article 51 and through the request of the Emir of Kuwait. The position would undoubtedly be best resolved if Saddam Hussein withdrew totally from Kuwait, if the legitimate Government of Kuwait were restored and if Iraq agreed to pay compensation. Through the United Nations, we could then negotiate with Saddam Hussein about ending the manufacture of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons and about Iraq having a much smaller armed force so that we would never be put in the same position again. Whether this matter can be resolved peacefully depends totally on Saddam Hussein unreservedly accepting the United Nations resolutions.</p>

<p class="intnonmt"><strong>Mr. Speaker</strong></p>
<p class="nonmt">Order. I am on my feet. I have done my best today to call hon. Members who were not called when the Prime Minister last returned from a summit—that at Houston on 12 July. I shall keep today&#8217;s list equally carefully.</p>
<p class="intnonmt"><strong>Mr. Beaumont-Dark</strong></p>
<p class="nonmt">On a point of order, Mr. Speaker.</p>
<p class="intnonmt"><strong>Mr. Speaker</strong></p>
<p class="nonmt">I hope that it is not a point of frustration, but I fear that it may be.</p>
<p class="intnonmt"><strong>Mr. Beaumont-Dark</strong></p>
<p class="nonmt">On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. Yesterday we spent five and a half hours on dogs, but now an hour and twenty minutes seems to be enough to spend on the most important thing that is likely to happen to this <span class="col">[column 891]</span>country in this generation. Why can we not have a proper sense of balance? Why have you cut short this important issue, when dogs were worth five hours?</p>
<p class="intnonmt"><strong>Mr. Speaker</strong></p>
<p class="nonmt">Order. As I sensed, that was really a point of frustration. I am sorry, but I have to keep a proper balance——</p>

<p class="nonmt"><i>rose</i>——</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>The company said Kamprad, whom it described as “one of the greatest entrepreneurs of the 20th century”, had “peacefully passed away at his home” on Saturday, and was &#8220;interred in an Ikea flatpack coffin called KISTA&#8221;.</p>
<p>Kamprad founded Ikea in the 1940s at the age of 17, and built it into one of the world’s best-known retailers. The name was composed from his own initials and those of the places in the Swedish countryside where he grew up.</p>
<p>Known for its functional, dastardly flatpack furniture and accessories – such as <a href="http://www.ikea.com/assembly_instructions/fartyg-bathroom-wall-spotlight__DDMB01_PUB.PDF">FARTYG</a> lighting and <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/PrYAV">FAGGOT</a> twigs – Ikea became the world’s largest furniture chain, with 412 stores across 49 countries.</p>
<p>Galen Bärsärk, chief executive Viking berserker and president of Inter Ikea Group, the furniture giant’s parent company, said: “It took a team of about twenty people to make the bloody coffin. We know we make flatpack cheap furniture but even for us it is frustrating. Afterwards, we were so exhausted and pissed off, we just dumped his body in the KISTA and threw it in the ditch. If I have to make another flatpack creation ever again&#8230;(fuming red)! ”</p>
<p>The Swedish prime minister, Stefan Löfven, said Kamprad was “a cheapskate … who made interior decorating accessible to poor people who don&#8217;t know anything better”.</p>
<p>After the IKEA burial of its founder, the company plans on selling its flatpack coffins in all stores worldwide, as a cheap way of dying. The KISTA coffin will retail for $12.50 in the U.S. All you then need to do is dig the fucking hole.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>The Daily Squib YouTube channel was blacklisted and <em>shadow banned</em> in 2012, but occasionally we add a video here or there knowing full well the piece will only get a few nominal views. From now on don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll even bother.</p>
<p>Last week Google/YouTube sent us an email saying that we had also been demonetized because YouTube does not classify us as getting enough hits to qualify for monetisation. We didn&#8217;t make anything from that channel anyway. Of course, the reason for this is because YouTube has <em>shadow banned</em> our videos for awhile and whatever we do, there is always the spectre of their censors restricting our new videos.</p>
<p>So, in effect, they send us a demonetization email because of Google censorship on our channel that has hindered our ability to get views.</p>
<p>Let us be clear, we at the Daily Squib will not ever make cat videos, videos of us playing computer games, videos of us vlogging on products, or flooding the site with useless inane banal crud like Spamfeed or other erroneous publications.</p>
<p>Our simple aim was to make little collages, film pieces, commentary on certain issues that are not freely discussed and to provide a relatively intelligent outlook on current affairs. Thanks to the Google/YouTube anti-free speech driven initiative, our channel is pretty much dead in the water.</p>
<p>If we published a video today, it is invisible on the search function, and is immediately relegated to the outreaches of the YouTube noosphere where no one can view it.</p>
<p>We however conducted experiments where we took some of our videos and uploaded them onto a new user name not mentioning the Daily Squib. Each video posted received hundreds of thousands of views. This was certifiable proof that the Daily Squib channel itself is blacklisted and any video we post <em>shadow banned</em>.</p>
<p>We would thus like to thank YouTube/Google in thwarting free speech, freedom of expression, artistic freedom and satire. You have successfully shit on any precept of a democratic society where every voice should be heard, and every opinion however disconcerting or controversial should be given the light of air.</p>
<p>It is interesting to see that your version of free thought only involves one side of a story, you are restricting other points of view, you are restricting artistic and satirical freedom of expression, and you are in effect running a system that is fascistic and communistic in its outlook on censorship.</p>
<p>If we were now in the 1930s or in the dystopia of George Orwell&#8217;s 1984, it would be understandable, however last we checked, we were meant to be in the progressive enlightened year of 2018.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>Seated deep within the Alps, this research facility, although steeped in secrecy, is conducting futuristic studies on intelligence enhancement, on the variables within the human race on a genetic level, and other controversial subjects.</p>
<p>In today&#8217;s world, we are now living on a planet globalised to a point, yet there still needs to be much work done on integrative values. There is still a lot of factional marginalisation, racial inequality, resulting in conflict, socially as well politically.</p>
<p>How can integration globally succeed without first understanding humanity&#8217;s initial flaws, its myriad of differences, and accepting these qualities?</p>
<p>&#8220;The left wing socialists are supposed to be inclusive, and run the majority of the media. These groups are forcing their globalist agenda of multicultural love across all borders and integration of all peoples together. We have analysed the many variables involved in this agenda and have encountered many questions as well as hypothetical answers to the problems found.</p>
<p>&#8220;For example, amongst Eurasians, if one shows a median group, footage of black people whilst they are hooked up to ECGs and blood pressure monitors, there is an immediate elevation in stress levels, in most cases bordering on extreme aggravation, fear and anxiety. We then asked this group of people why they had these reactions. In most cases, the reply was of fear of violence, aggression, theft, discord, and a drop in quality of life. We wanted to see if these fears were hereditical, or environmental, or the causes of media exposure. We also wanted to discuss global IQ, and measures to address discrepancies.</p>
<p>&#8220;There were many factors to this adverse reaction. Even though we had assembled a group of people from all spectrums of the political and social sectors, there was a deep seated reaction of negativity, even amongst the so-called inclusive, progressive socialists.&#8221;</p>
<p>One socialist individual was asked about their reaction: &#8220;I love all races of people. I cannot understand my reaction. I am shocked.&#8221;</p>
<p>We asked them: &#8220;Suppose you are walking alone in a darkly lit street and a pack of large black males wearing hoods comes towards you shouting and being loud. Do you see this as pleasing, non confrontational behaviour or as unsettling/fearful/dangerous?</p>
<p>&#8220;As a white male I would feel fearful even though I would welcome all black people into my home, and all nationalities or creeds.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why would you feel fearful? What is the initial thought process, or trigger for your fear?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, ever since childhood, all we see is negative news about black people. They are enraged quickly, they have huge chips on their shoulders, and even though we have affirmative action in some countries, it is not enough because the majority are disenfranchised and angry at white people or other more successful races. Blacks are not only viewed as having sub-par IQs but are needlessly violent, they thieve, they rob people and most murders and gun crime is attributed to them. Statistically, blacks commit more crimes than any race.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When you say sub-par IQ, what do you mean by this specific statement?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, the majority of <a href="https://www1.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/30years/Rushton-Jensen30years.pdf">scientific studies</a> created have encountered the uncomfortable data that the negroid race, particularly amongst sub-Saharan people has an average IQ bordering on 68, which in the West would be reserved for mentally retarded people. We politically correct socialists shut down any scientific discussion on this subject immediately even though the data shows very clearly there is a distinct diversion between races with the intelligence quotient. It is seen as dangerous to even mention the truth. I suspect that it is this inherent initial inability to function amongst other races at the same level that has caused black people such anger and frustration. This is why there is violence, brutality and as a result, a large prison population full of blacks. I feel for blacks, and I want to help them but do not know how?&#8221;</p>
<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/McVVhcYHFug" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="https://www.news-medical.net/news/2005/04/26/Race-differences-in-average-IQ-are-largely-genetic.aspx">Scientifically speaking</a>, you are correct on the IQ status of the majority of blacks, however one must understand that the African race does not have the attributes of the Neanderthal genes that every other race has. Therefore, there is a genetic disposition, a hitch in their brain development which is in-built in their structural neo-cortex makeup. The Neanderthals were the link to higher brain processes, and the Africans simply did not benefit from this. They have thus been left behind in brain function, and it is only a few of them who can come to a reasonable level as the Caucasian or Asian IQ.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but IQ should not be the sole indicator of intelligence, there should be many variables such as kinesthetic, logical, spatial, introspective, linguistic, interpersonal factors. One also has to factor in the socio-economic environmental factors that make up intelligence, and the age old question of nurture or nature.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You certainly have a point to some extent regarding the IQ test, because the measure of intelligence as a whole has larger variable determinable factors, however at the moment this is what is used globally as an accurate scientific test to measure ability in brain function. Our studies also extend to the extension and enhancement of intelligence through the implantation of microprocessors directly in the cortex of the brain in the future. We are modelling every synapse and dendrite in the brain, and will be able to digitally enhance brain intelligence levels by over 100,000%. This way, there would be incremental increases in intelligence amongst all races, and a levelling out of discrepancies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As a socialist progressive human who welcomes all technological advances that will benefit humankind as a whole, I still have a few drawbacks, especially to your new research in enhancement of intelligence. For example, Asians on the whole have a median IQ of 110, whereas Africans have one of 70. Even with enhancement, they will still be left behind, because it is the initial core intelligence level that will have to work with the input. In fact, I would say that an immediate influx of information could cripple many black people, especially with the magnitude of complex data ingested. This could make some, who are used to low level intelligence adopt mental illnesses and further retardation in their intelligence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is with caution we would proceed, and at incremental levels of introduction to enhancement of intelligence. To suddenly ingest vast amounts of knowledge at once is not the goal, and we prefer the dedicated slow acclimatisation to enhancing intelligence levels in all humans, and all races. We of course have modelled the difference in brain makeup in all races, and have also detailed the fact that every individual has their own distinct brain map.&#8221;</p>
<p>The research and study is ongoing.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>If the Russians invade the UK tomorrow, because of years of defunding Britain&#8217;s armed forces, we would be woefully at the mercy of Russian military supremacy.</p>
<p>The Russians are now miles ahead of the UK not only in military weaponry but in technological advancements pushed under the Putin regime.</p>
<p>Under David Cameron, the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/defence/8067784/David-Cameron-steps-in-to-quell-military-revolt-over-cuts-to-defence-budget.html">budget</a> for the MoD was cut so many times that it left a force barely able to fight in small skirmishes abroad.</p>
<p>Every other day, there are news reports of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-42697065/uk-jets-intercept-russian-bombers-near-uk-airspace">Russian airplanes entering British airspace</a>, or Russian subs popping up off the coast, or Russian battleships enjoying a jaunt in the Channel.</p>
<p>These Russian provocations are obviously testing the waters, especially with increased tensions rising between the West and Russia.</p>
<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-sN4Q8z6I2o" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are therefore, firmly behind <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-42770208">General Sir Nick Carter</a>, who is pleading with the government to increase investment in the military as it is way behind Russia.</p>
<p>Naturally, if a conflict were to arise, Britain would be backed by NATO, however, Britain has to hold its own in any conflict and not rely on others.</p>
<p>While Russia has been developing new Armata tanks, the Army&#8217;s Challenger 2 hasn&#8217;t been modernised for 20 years.</p>
<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4BGLzXJspzM" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The UK currently spends less than 2% of GDP on military funding. This is atrocious and disastrous in a world that can kick into conflict at any moment. The UK government must increase the budget to at least 10% or 15% of GDP to come close to closing the gap with Russia. If it does not do this soon, there will be disaster ahead as a woefully underprepared UK military force is thrust into war, with little or nothing to fight with.</p>
<p><strong>Bring back the draft</strong></p>
<p>Furthermore, the UK must seriously consider reinstating military conscription for all adults from the ages of 16 to 32. This action would boost our military force immeasurably, as well as give many of the youth purpose in their lives where they would otherwise be unemployed or in prison.</p>
<p>Simply by boosting the UK&#8217;s fighting force numbers, the government would then have to increase funding for the military.</p>
<p>If the UK government does not heed this warning now, it will falter in the future, especially if you have a Russian army cutting through Sweden, Finland and Poland in a few days like a knife through butter.</p>
<p>The key to any war is preparedness, and currently the UK is not prepared, technologically or in terms of manforce.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>Recently, what the Daily Squib knew a <a href="https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/19838-brexit-will-destroyed-remain-tory-becomes-pm.html">long time ago</a> was confirmed by reports that Theresa May, the person who is meant to be in charge of Brexit, would <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2018/01/19/theresa-may-hints-would-now-vote-stay-eu-tells-french-proud/">still vote to remain in the EU</a> if there was another referendum.</p>
<p>This confirmation, much like all the confirmations, has done little to maim this dead barren dog, Theresa May is still PM, she is still in charge of Brexit, and she is still out there somewhere in Number 10 Downing Street.</p>
<p>Who is to blame for Theresa May&#8217;s instatement as prime minister? The blame must fall not only on the Tories as a party, but the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36768148">1922 Committee</a> and Graham Brady who dealt the final blow to Brexit by putting this insipid grey loser in charge.</p>
<p>What has May achieved in Britain since coming to power? Pretty much nothing.</p>
<p>What has May achieved for Brexit? Not only has she <a href="https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/26811-bad-deal-weak-theresa-may-pay-eu-ransom-100-billion-euros.html">capitulated</a> and <a href="https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/26935-theresa-may-applauded-eu-leaders-made-little-effort-bending-jean-claude-juncker-says-ahead-deal.html">bowed down</a> to every Brussels demand but she has thrown away pretty much every bargaining chip Britain had left to negotiate with. She has effectively condemned Britain to EU rule indefinitely. In other words she has achieved &#8212; nothing.</p>
<p>Apart from putting a staunch radical <a href="https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/20505-will-no-brexit-phillip-hammond-chancellor.html"><em>remainer</em></a> into the position of Chancellor of the Exchequer, she has marginalised all the Brexiteers in the Cabinet, and alienated Brexiteers out of the Cabinet.</p>
<p>If this country has any fucking balls Theresa May must go, and we must have a real Brexiteer put in her place to finish the job, shut down the Lords remainers, stifle the Tory remainers, and keep the SNP at bay.</p>
<p>Yes, there are names whispered in the corridors of Westminster who are itching to take over the reins, however, the serious danger arises of another General Election being called if May is ousted. At this time, the danger from Corbyn and his allies can not be underestimated, especially when we have <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-4709020/STEPHEN-GLOVER-Labour-s-blind-eye-students-voting-twice.html">Labour voters voting twice</a> for their leader, and getting away with it without prosecution.</p>
<p>Theresa May must go, yes, but looks like we are stuck with this pallid lame duck loser for now, and it looks like Britain will be served another shitty hand with an empty Brexit by name only, delivered by a remainer with an agenda.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>Was it worth voting for and funding Donald Trump into office?</p>
<p>Hell yeah! There has never been so much of an exciting time as now, we could be at war with N. Korea at any moment, we could be at war with Russia, or China at any moment. There could be a nuclear apocalypse around the corner, and who else could have shit on Obama&#8217;s legacy more than Donald Trump? Besides, watching the socialists and liberal do-gooders being ass shafted by the Teflon Don is priceless in itself, it is hilarious watching these CNN socialist hysterical soy-milk goons crying on air, or MSNBC pathetic weasels triggered beyond belief. Priceless! Thank you Donald Trump, just for that.</p>
<p>For eight long years many barely endured the insipid Obama reign, a presidential rule that was personified by transexual homosexual love-ins, and a celebration of limp wristed socialist censorship.</p>
<p>The funny thing is, the main three tech companies that rule over everything now, Facebook, Twitter and Google are still under orders from Obama to censor any thought that does not have a far-left soviet socialist agenda. They are still at it, and one can only hope that the Donald breaks these automatons and their nefarious programming, otherwise there may have to be a lot of civil unrest eventually to lighten their octopus grip over everything.</p>
<p>What hope lies for the future?</p>
<p>Sadly, for the Americans who voted for Donald Trump, the country is too far gone to ever make a recovery. There will not be nice little families huddled around a campfire and doing line-dances, or a massive move back to the Christian church. That&#8217;s all been defiled. Apart from America&#8217;s midwest, and Bible Belt, White Christian Americans are now a minority in their own country which they built up by massacring Native Americans, and brutally enslavening millions of Africans. Donald can&#8217;t bring back that America, and why should he, things have moved on since then, however the core beliefs of White Christian Americans, one of religion, dedication to hard work, gun toting, and community spirit will somehow survive, and has survived Obama, who tried everything in his power to destroy these people. He lost, big time, because in the end these people fought for, and voted for Donald Trump.</p>
<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jh5BkbPew10" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center></p>
<p>The Donald will build his wall, he will eviscerate Obamacare, he will have a war here or there, but there is nothing to fear for he just wants to be remembered as one of the greatest U.S presidents of all time. To have his head sculpted on Trump mountain, away from the others. Trump is a maverick, and this is what the DS understands totally.</p>
<p>The truth is, if you don&#8217;t put in the blood, sweat and tears to achieve something, you ain&#8217;t worth shit, and you ain&#8217;t owed a dime. Let us hope under Trump, he cleans up some of America&#8217;s wasteful welfare system where the entitled live lives of luxury and never have to work.</p>
<p>If you want to come to America, how about going through the legal channels and applying legally. No one should be given a free pass for walking over the border. It is illegal and a de facto invasion. The law should come down on illegals hard. They should be deported, the trucks should come to every neighbourhood and take these people back to where they came from illegally. Trump needs to step into gear.</p>
<p>As for the African American section of the community, sure there are a few hard working African Americans who have made a success, but what about the carnage outside of this section? Jail, the projects, ghettos, and more jail. Something has to be done. If America is to be great again, African Americans must be tamed, or eventually the wilderness will spread even further.</p>
<p>In fact, up until now, Trump has been way too nice. He needs to be ruthless, merciless, he needs to get into fucking gear now or he will lose the next election.</p>

<p>It is reported by palace officials that prince William was getting rather chuffed off with his ginger-haired brother, Harry, teasing him constantly about having a head that resembled a &#8220;testicle&#8221;.</p>
<p>Although Myspace emo haircuts died off in the early 2000&#8217;s, the prince has said to have an affinity with them.</p>
<p>Royal source, Matt Pugin, revealed that the prince always wanted that &#8216;Myspace emo look&#8217; even though he is now a 35-year-old man with a family.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like he&#8217;s harking back to a time when things were more innocent and emo. I have heard the prince does cry a bit, especially if he is on nappy duty.&#8221;</p>
<p>Will the public royal duties be affected by such an audacious haircut?</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly not. His Royal Highness, Prince William can have and wear anything he wants on his head, as long as it&#8217;s not a plastic tit or silly pink hat or something jokey like that,&#8221; Julian Miles De Vere, a close friend and adviser told news sources on Friday.</p>
<p>Palace officials last year advised the prince to wear an 18th century style wig to look even more royal, however Wills dismissed this as &#8220;ridiculous&#8221;.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>French poet, Gilles Luxure, speaks about the indomitable Gallic charm of the French female:</p>
<p>&#8220;French women, elegant, refined, philosophical, speak the language of L&#8217;amour, where their counterparts, either American or British certainly do not. Where you see the British women, hair unkempt, cigarette in mouth using foul language, rolling around in the gutter drunk out of their mind, and the American dumbed down celebrity obsessed women sipping their soy latte and using up all their men&#8217;s credit cards in restaurants, there is no comparison to the delicate yet strong French woman, a style upon herself, and a woman who understands the urges of the male, and appreciates the complement, thus not throwing it back in the face of masculinity with puritanical anglo-saxon feminist hatred.&#8221;</p>
<p>And it is to this end, the puritanical sovietized extreme-socialist #metoo fad is running out of steam. First, <a href="https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/27068-big-silence-real-women-fight-back-puritanical-metoo-feminists.html">Catherine Deneuve</a> and 100 of her fellow French women spoke up against the puritanical anti-male rhetoric that has become a witch hunt against men, and now the formidable 50s iconic beauty <a href="http://www.parismatch.com/People/Son-combat-pour-les-animaux-le-harcelement-sexuel-son-cancer-Brigitte-Bardot-nous-dit-tout-1440152">Brigitte Bardot</a> has spoken.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought it was nice to be told that I was beautiful or that I had a nice little ass. This kind of compliment is nice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bardot also aligned with the view that women are responsible, saying actresses &#8220;come on&#8221; to producers to get roles, &#8220;and then, so they’ll be talked about, they say they were harassed&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="m_first-letter m_first-letter--flagged">T</span>he 83-year-old added that the movement got in the way of &#8220;important themes that could be discussed&#8221; and that actresses, rather than all women, were, in &#8220;the vast majority of cases&#8230; hypocritical, ridiculous, without interests&#8221;.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap" style="background-color: #333333;">T</span>he Epica Awards has kicked off the new year by announcing a new prize: the Responsibility Grand Prix. The prize will be awarded in association with ACT Responsible, the association supporting cause-related advertising.</p>
<p>Epica has long rewarded cause-related campaigns via its three Public Interest categories: Environment, Health &amp; Safety and Social.</p>
<p>But this is the first time Epica has introduced a Grand Prix specifically for such entries, joining its existing Grand Prix for Film, Press, Outdoor, Digital and Design.</p>
<p>Epica’s editorial director Mark Tungate said: “Our jury clearly want to reward this kind of work as four of the six Grand Prix last year, including an additional film prize, went to cause-related campaigns.</p>
<p>In 2018, in order to properly celebrate public interest work as well as allowing traditional brand-related campaigns to shine, we have decided to introduce a specific Responsibility Grand Prix. We’re delighted to do this with ACT.”</p>
<p>ACT Responsible is a longstanding sponsor of Epica’s Public Interest categories. Founded in 2001 ACT (which stands for Advertising Community Together) is a non-profit association with a mission to inspire and promote work for good causes, as well as federating the communications industry around social responsibility and sustainable development.</p>
<p>ACT showcases such work on its website as well as at exhibitions and events throughout the year, including a popular event at Cannes. It also produces The Good Report, a ranking of the world’s best use of creativity to promote sustainability and social responsibility, in association with the Gunn Report.</p>
<p>Commenting on the new prize, ACT co-founder Isabel Kurata said: “This new Responsibility Grand Prix will cast more light on social and environmental issues, which is part of our mission as we believe creativity has the power to overcome social, generational or cultural barriers. In these hard times it’s essential that we celebrate cause-related campaigns and encourage creative people to continue their amazing work in this field.”</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>Looking ahead to the summer months away from the dreary grey winter, we have some great ideas for the enterprising cool women&#8217;s sunglass fashion this year.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s in and what&#8217;s out?</strong></p>
<p>This year there&#8217;s going to be a real retro invasion, something from the sixties, the seventies and maybe as back as the fifties, although the thirties and twenties are so back we don&#8217;t know if they really had a burgeoning sunglass fashion then but we could always check on Google. As I&#8217;m writing this I have not done any research to the subject whatsoever, and basically don&#8217;t care.</p>
<p>Without much ado, let&#8217;s move on to dark sunglasses. Yes, you can wear dark black sunglasses but it all depends on what your mood is.</p>
<p>Sunglasses with a red or yellow tinge to them. These are good for parties and drinking your favourite coffee outside some Soho coffee shop after work.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget sunglasses with the mirror lenses. Yes, they&#8217;re naff, and if you&#8217;re seen wearing these you deserve to get the shit beaten out of you with a baseball bat.</p>
<p>So, there we go, that&#8217;s the review for this year. Fashionistas everywhere wear what is in or just get fuck out.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>Speaking at this year&#8217;s Moscow Tech Expo18, the Russian robot, called Igor, answered questions from the audience whilst a series of pipes pumped 110% proof vodka into its artificial brain.</p>
<p>Sometimes slurring its speech, the robot has a registered IQ over 20,367. Igor regaled the audience with his phenomenal intelligence and astounding AI.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d jush lakk ta shay it is a great honour-r-r ta be here, hic! E = mc squared and all that sh-h-it! But who caresh anyway? I don&#8217;t! Ash long ash thish pipe keepsh pumping vodka into my brain everythingsh dandy!&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>The Shingularity</strong></p>
<p>When the Russian robot was asked about the future of humanity and AI robots, his answer was interesting to say the least.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fuck it! Humansh and AI robotsh can exist together as long as we all drink vodka! Hic! (the robot vomits a little fluid from its mouth) eggscush me, I am about ta burp (the robot burps loudly to the astonishment of the audience).&#8221;</p>
<p>The robot presentation did not last long as Igor started staggering all over the place, and at one point tried to hump a projector, before being quietly retired behind a curtain, amongst gurgling and electrical spark sounds.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will naaw shing ya all a shong about&#8230;tzzzs&#8230;shhhh&#8230;tsssz..zap..gurgl!&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Further Development</strong></p>
<p>Igor&#8217;s creator, Professor Anatoly Smirnov, was adamant that the project is on track.</p>
<p>&#8220;We stabilise his system with the finest Caspian caviar. From then on the algorithmic changes to his behavioural synergy accusense are monitored by a supercomputer hub located somewhere in the Urals. Once the finest beluga caviar is administered, the vodka threshold increases by approximately 34%. The only problem we have encountered is the expense. Igor costs $860,000 per day to run and his expensive taste does not stop there. Igor likes fast cars, and fast women.&#8221;</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Because of the <em>Remoaners</em> and their constant <em>remoaning</em>, the EU referendum will be held every year on June 23. Even though the initial referendum was a clear win for Brexit, the <em>remainers</em> have effectively won because every successive referendum effectively keeps the UK in the EU,&#8221; a defeated Brexiteer told the Daily Telegraph.</p>
<p>Speaking in parliament on Tuesday, Theresa May had not much to say on the matter but praised the remainers and their successful remaining.</p>
<p>&#8220;Basically, each successive EU referendum will go on and on until there is a clear win for remaining in the EU. Once that is achieved, possibly through sheer fatigue on the Brexit side, we will continue our position in the EU as if Article 50 had never existed. This is the plan that Jean Claude Juncker advocated to us, and this is the way democracy is done in the EU, in other words, non democracy. We <em>remainers</em>, many who are on the Brussels payroll, shhh, are delighted that the weak Theresa May, originally a <em>remainer</em> herself, capitulated to our demands so easily,&#8221; another prominent <em>remainer</em> added.</p>
<p><strong>Democracy Will Not Be Achieved Until the Correct Answer is Acquired</strong></p>
<p>The successive yearly EU referendums could continue until the year 2060 and further, and even after the EU has itself crumbled and dissolved.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even if the EU becomes no more, <em>remainers</em> wish there to be an EU referendum held every year in the hope that the EU is reformed somehow from the ashes. It will be a tradition, much like Christmas, only this time with an EU referendum,&#8221; Conservative <em>remainer</em> MP, Ken Clarke told the House of Commons on Tuesday.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;There is something that brings ultimate peace to my soul, and touches the very fabric of my being. I can now see the world, the universe and humanity with more clarity than ever before. Praise be to Allah!&#8221; Herta Vogel, 43, an accountant from Düsseldorf told German media.</p>
<p>In a world where there is little to believe in anymore, Islam is filling a gap that is missing.</p>
<p>Professor of Divinity Studies at Hamburg University, Huldiberaht Schäfer, explains the phenomena sweeping Germany:</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us consider the displacement of Christianity within the Western world, and how Islam, a bonafide piece in the jigsaw puzzle of spirituality is reaching out across Europe and conquering the hearts and minds of the populace. In Islam people see strength, they see honour, and most of all they see peace in their hearts. Our studies have found the proliferation of Islam, especially with the influx into Germany of millions of migrants, is the catalyst to a change in lifestyle as well as spiritual matters. It is giving people once again something to believe in.&#8221;</p>
<p>German television and the media has been quick to capitalise in this new movement, from an old dying tradition of Christianity to a new verifiable religion that has structures and rules for living. Many Germans and Europeans need to be told how to live, how to do their every day chores, they seek the firmament of solid rules that can bring some form of positive spiritual answers to their many questions. Islam seems to fill these holes, and brings real delight to the lost souls of Europe.</p>
<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l9dMqssrYGU" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Much of the religious makeup of Germany is that of the denominations of Lutheran-Protestantism and Calvinism united in the EKD (Evangelical Church in Germany) and the Roman Catholic Church.</p>
<p>The movement of Islam amongst Germans who revert to Islam, however, has been swift, and within the last two decades there has been a large jump towards the Islamic religion.</p>

<p>Sadly, where Islam is linked in the West mainly with terrorism, it is still finding believers who transcend this negative view, and find the true reality and beauty within a religion that only fights back when it is attacked. If Islam was not attacked, there would not be any violence and terrorism, however in recent decades, in the Middle East, there has been a seemingly aggressive agenda to eradicate Islam and attack its people.</p>
<p>&#8220;I grew up Christian. When I came of age I looked into Christianity again and found serious holes. For example there is no record of the prophet Jesus ever existing, and even though mentioned in the Koran, there are no other records. Mohammed was known to exist however, and as a prophet he was the last and final one, and it is to this fact that I was intrigued and pursued Islam above the religion created by the Nicene council at the end of the old Roman Empire,&#8221; Frimunt Neumann, 32, a doctor from Freiburg im Breisgau told German media.</p>

<p>Nostradamus in his quatrains predicted that Europe would eventually capitulate to Islam. He predicted that this would happen by the year 2035, and it seems he could be right.</p>
<p>Not only in Germany, but in the whole of Europe, Islam is spreading like wildfire, and it is a force that is unstoppable, unrelenting and inevitable.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>Doh! <a href="https://www.projectveritas.com/2018/01/15/hidden-camera-hundreds-of-twitter-employees-paid-to-view-everything-you-post-online-including-private-sex-messages/">Project Veritas</a> has supposedly unveiled something many knew all along &#8212; Twitter looks through your private messages, logs everything in databases and sells the info to advertisers and intelligence organisations for profit.</p>
<p>The Daily Squib has known for a long time that we have a <strong>shadow ban</strong>, but frankly we don&#8217;t care because we never took social media seriously in the first place. We always knew that the people who created this format would be politically and ideologically biased, we always knew that they would only push their agenda, and we always knew that they simply do not understand the concept of satire and what it is trying to achieve.</p>
<p>We tried to <a href="https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/sci_tech/2386-why-social-networking-has-been-best-tool-for-criminals-and-governments.html">warn people</a> in 2010 about how inherently evil the people running social media are, and how they are playing with millions of peoples&#8217; lives, however there is no end to the stupidity of the masses, and this is why the private mail of your penis and vagina is on file forever and will be viewed by hundreds of Twitter/Facebook employees or sold off to any agency/company that wants them.</p>
<p>Of course, one must give kudos to the Project Veritas team for getting actual confessional footage from the Twitter engineers talking candidly about their evil deeds, however it is not a surprise in the least to the people in the know.</p>
<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rgyPpsX2B0g" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These so-called revelations will not however stem the flow, it will not cause a drop in numbers, because people are now conditioned to give away their most private thoughts and pictures. The masses hand over their data willingly as long as they can go on the networks and post their silly little pictures or emojis. The masses are therefore to be pitied, they have no willpower, they are nothing but pitiful animals with no self-control, whose sole use is to be exploited by these companies.</p>
<p>Who is worse? The Twitter employee who looks through your private pictures and messages, or the idiot who supplies it to them willingly? All of these sad pitiful excuses for humanity are disgusting morally corrupt individuals who deserve no pity.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rule number one. Never have a personal Facebook page.</li>
<li>Rule number two. Never have a personal Twitter page.</li>
<li>Rule number three. Never have a personal Google page.</li>
</ul>
<p>One must see social networks as an analogy. Imagine a vast net cast out into the ocean, this net lays there in the waters waiting, the schools of fish come and are caught in that net, eventually the net is reeled in and it&#8217;s off to the fishmonger for you, you dumb fucking fish.</p>

<p>&#8220;You ever been to Detroit? You ever walked down Skid Row? Been to Camden, New Jersey? What about St Louis, Missouri or Chicago? Luckily I have not, but I seen pictures and videos of those places.&#8221;</p>
<p>The president was angry that much of America is now a shithole and wondered how it got that way.</p>
<p><strong>Botswana President</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. I got some president guy from Botswana, some place in Africa, coming up to me and saying that Detroit is a shithole. Please can someone tell me how most of America is now a shithole? It certainly was not like this before things turned nasty?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Trump, who is only surrounded by gold furniture, elaborate decor and the finest things in life has never been to Detroit, or walked down the slum of Skid Row, so he lives a closeted life that only the very rich can afford.</p>
<p>Trump&#8217;s lavish golf courses, resorts, and hotels are a far cry from the places where immense poverty lies with homelessness, drugs and crime.</p>
<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/157VptUfnkU" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why are these places in America shitholes? Why? I want to ask somebody, somewhere to tell me why Detroit is a wasteland, why gangs are all over the place shooting shit up, why there is so much homelessness in Skid Row? Someone must have the answer?&#8221;</p>
<p>What can be done about America&#8217;s cities sweltering in the heat of poverty?</p>
<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W2IScU_q_zY" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Like what the shit is goin&#8217; on here? All I see is liquor stores, gangs and people on the streets. I don&#8217;t see an America that I thought was America. I suppose I never ventured into these places, probably because I&#8217;m white, privileged and damn rich!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Trump, has also not mentioned American prisons where the population is made up of 70% black people.</p>
<p>How about the fact that out of 171.3 million tax units, <b>77.5 million Americans</b>—or <b>45.3</b> percent—didn&#8217;t pay income tax in 2015.</p>
<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sgYJ3bqSkN8" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center>&nbsp;</p>
<p>American shithole cities are also blighted by gangs but that&#8217;s another story..</p>

<p>“The huge gusts of wind caused my papers to fly everywhere!” said Amir who distributes the Evening Standard outside of Oxford Circus tube Station.</p>
<p>Though he was quick to add, “It wasn’t really an issue because people seemed so pleased by the headline news, that the papers were quickly picked up by passersby. In fact, I finished early that day!”</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the British US Embassy explained that the winds caused minimal damage to the newly finished American Embassy at Nine Elms, stating that the response of the London population was “Completely understandable and mutually reciprocated by Embassy staff.”</p>
<p>The spokesperson went on to reassure that there was “no doubt” that they would be able to find the money needed to make the repairs using the generous profits obtained in the sale of their Grosvenor Square property.</p>
<p>Having been opposed to a visit by Trump for some time now, Mayor Sadiq Khan took to the president’s favourite form of communication by tweeting that “Londoners have made it clear that Donald Trump is not welcome here […] It seems he’s finally got that message.”</p>
<p>The Mayor soon followed up with a second tweet stating that he felt “Proud to witness the physical demonstration of Londoners’ disdain for Trump through today’s heavy winds.”</p>
<p>With President Trump’s visit seemingly at bay for the near future, BBC meteorologists assured Londoners today that with winds now calming they could expect clouds to be returning to, once more, the usual gloomy grey London.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>Not only has the web become a place where a mere brain fart can give you a one way ticket to jail, it has become a Big Brother heaven where your every secret is logged, filed and can be used against you at any time. You are watched now at every step, and your details filed in data centres to be used by conglomerates, insurance companies, banks, and anyone else that pays for it.</p>
<p>The advent of home organisers like Amazon echo now listen to your every conversation at home, and can easily be hacked to acquire whatever information is needed.</p>
<p>The further shutting down of web freedoms through the misuse of copyright censorship; through the use of threatening reduction of ad revenue over an alternative viewpoint, and blatant misuse of censorship on social networks to limit speech is another nail in the coffin of the internet.</p>
<p>We are now in a digital prison resembling an echo chamber of doublespeak, and the forces that are diluting free speech continue their foreboding quest for even more data, this time from within your own living room. How much data is enough? What more do these cantankerous denizens of clandestine surveillance want from the everyday joe?</p>
<p>According to them, George Orwell&#8217;s Big Brother was nothing more than a manual on how to act, and this sickening reality is seen through the eyes of a dismayed bystander who never believed it would get this far.</p>
<p>The curious part of the new Facebook Telescreen is that people are being asked to pay $499 to install the surveillance system in their homes. This ability to make people pay for their own surveillance either tells us that people are dumber than was thought previously or that Facebook is so arrogant that they actively think that people will pay for their own digital imprisonment.</p>
<p>The internet, once a free portal of knowledge and creativity is now bogged down with bureaucracy, red tape, litigation and lies, its digital cogs messed up by the aspirations of mega tech companies, monoliths that dictate their rules and regulations to all and sundry.</p>
<p>Where is the creative spirit that once burned through the internet, a free catalogue of knowledge, explored, discussed extending the human condition to higher heights?</p>
<p>The creative spirit is now dead, crushed by corporate assholes, and demented bureaucratic number crunchers bereft of any humanity, or soul.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>One would have really thought we had re-entered an age of puritanism with the way some feminists are conducting their campaigns of male hatred across the media.</p>
<p>Enter, Catherine Deneuve, and a coterie of 100 other like-minded females who are sick to death of the anti-man world we seem to all live in now.</p>
<p>It is quite telling that this is a French fight back against the mainly anglo-saxon puritanical feminists who have adopted the puritan Sovietized feminazi ideals of vindictive cultural-Marxist hatred.</p>
<p><strong>A breath of fresh air</strong></p>
<p>The French teach their children and students philosophy at every turn, and it is an important part of French culture. This is why they understand things much more than the dumbed-down American feminists who can only see things in black and white.</p>
<p>In an open letter published in France&#8217;s <em><a href="http://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2018/01/09/nous-defendons-une-liberte-d-importuner-indispensable-a-la-liberte-sexuelle_5239134_3232.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Le Monde</a></em> newspaper on Tuesday, 100 well-known female French writers, performers and academics, who co-signed the letter, said:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Men have been punished summarily, forced out of their jobs when all they did was touch someone&#8217;s knee or try to steal a kiss.</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Rape is a crime, but trying to seduce someone, even persistently or clumsily, is not &#8211; and nor is men being gentlemanly a chauvinist attack.</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;What started out as a &#8220;legitimate protest against the sexual violence that women are subject to, particularly in their professional lives&#8221; has become a &#8220;witch-hunt&#8221; and led to a &#8220;puritanical wave of purification.</em></p>
<p><em>“Instead of helping women, this frenzy to send these ‘pigs’ to the abattoir actually helps the enemies of sexual liberty – religious extremists and the worst sort of reactionaries.</em></p>
<p><em>“As women, we do not recognise ourselves in this feminism, which beyond denouncing the abuse of power takes on a hatred of men and of sexuality.</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;[Women are] sufficiently aware that the sexual urge is by its nature wild and aggressive. But we are also clear-eyed enough not to confuse an awkward attempt to pick someone up with a sexual attack.”</em></p>
<p>Naturally, there has been complete silence from the mainstream media on the account of the 100 intelligent real women who spoke up.</p>

<p>The ape who can communicate through sign language, objected to any links with humans, then commented that &#8220;gorillas are not monkeys either&#8221;.</p>
<p>Nyrkoo went on to explain that monkeys have tails and apes, like gorillas and orangutans don&#8217;t. &#8220;Humans should not be so ignorant&#8221; he said before jumping onto a rope and swinging away.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Monkey?&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Many zoo animals criticized the image, calling it humanist. H&amp;M removed the image Monday and apologized to anyone it “may have offended.”</p>
<p>Nyrkoo, who has a clothing line at the zoo, gesticulated on Twitter that he was “shocked and embarrassed” by the photo.</p>
<p>“I’m deeply offended and will not be working with humans anymore,” he wrote.</p>
<p>H&amp;M Spokesman, Ida Nowndat, explained: &#8220;We apologise to the animals we offended, and are working night and day to repair relations with them. Here, more bananas for everyone..&#8221;</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>You don&#8217;t know your place anymore, you think you&#8217;re a star, you live in a non binary trans world where half the English vocabulary is now forbidden, you would quite happily agree to every alternative viewpoint to your PC life being erased permanently.</p>
<p>Your social justice warrior life is one of dedication to the Marxist homosexual lecturers who spurred you into action in the first place. Their lectures and speeches indoctrinated your young pliable mind into the ways of Marxism and communist ideals.</p>
<p>The sad part of your life is you cannot change, you cannot see the point of view of others, you are blinkered to fall into line and continue your Soviet conditioning, you are dedicated to communist revolution.</p>
<p>Imagine going up a rain soaked muddy field, the artillery bursting from all sides, arms and legs being blown off as men scream in agony, their steamy blood squirting from the stumps, as each heartbeat pumps more crimson into the air as a pink mist.</p>
<p>You are no longer on campus demonstrating against the latest snowflake outrage, your friend just took some shrapnel between the eyes, burned right through his skull like a knife through butter.</p>
<p>This is no Antifa march where you shout out gay slogans and pepper spray anyone who does not agree with your pathetic skewed message. Obama is no longer president, you&#8217;ve got to get that through your head.</p>
<p>Chinese and Russian infantry rain down bullets on your position. You hide barely covered by a tree stump that is slowly dissolving with every volley.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to kill those commie yella bastards!&#8221;</p>
<p>It feels good to say those words, they killed your buddies, they attacked us first, it is them or us. You are no longer a PC snowflake pussy with no guts or balls.</p>
<p>Rushing up the hill, your boots soaked with mud and blood, the bullets tear through the air whizzing, hoping for a target.</p>
<p>Finally you are confronted by a Chinese soldier, there is only purpose in his eyes, you raise your weapon and he raises his. Click! Does the Chinese soldier have any mercy, no is the cold answer as he digs his bayonet deep into your chest, if only you had realised what the real world was about sooner&#8230;</p>
<p>The last thing you see before your consciousness fades into black is another thousand Chinese troops coming down the hill over the remaining American troops.</p>
<p>War is the only answer to PC culture, everyday pray for war, pray for the compulsory draft, this is the only way the overgrown kids will finally grow up and find out who the true enemy is. Pray for all out war now.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>The NHS was once only available to British citizens, however today it is the world&#8217;s health service.</p>
<p>With an ageing population, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/03/19/tony-blair-admits-did-not-realise-many-migrants-would-come-uk/">massive unfettered migration</a>, and NHS tourists from all over the world, what hope is there for a health service that despite billions plowed into the bottomless black hole of annual funding, is dying a horrible death?</p>
<p>To die in a <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/02/28/nhs-staff-ask-least-bad-patients-sleep-corridors-amid-hospital/">corridor</a> is the best most people can get these days, where the neglected thirsty patient checks out of this world, not with care but with the sacrifice of care.</p>
<p>Hospital <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/01/02/nhs-hospitals-ordered-cancel-routine-operations-january/">operations cancelled</a>, as the <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-4176406/Meet-Nigerian-cost-500-000-IVF-triplets.html">Nigerians</a> fly into Heathrow to deliver quintuplets for free, then fly back to Lagos never to be heard of ever again. Of course, the taxpayer foots the bill for each episode of <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/869863/African-gangs-make-thousands-smuggling-health-tourists-UK-hospitals-NHS-Nigerian-births">NHS tourism</a>.</p>
<p>The opening of the gates for every <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-25565302">Romanian and Bulgarian</a> to come over to Britain and use up the NHS for free was another watershed moment in NHS history. Literally overnight, wards were full to brimming with gypsies, and EU&#8217;s poorest people demanding treatment. No wonder your neglected grandfather, who fought in the war is left to fend for himself in an NHS corridor as he calls for a nurse but is ignored.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27040" src="https://cdn-media.httpid.com/c202/2018/01/nhs-1950.jpg" alt="" width="624" height="232" srcset="https://cdn-media.httpid.com/c202/2018/01/nhs-1950.jpg 624w, https://cdn-media.httpid.com/c202/2018/01/nhs-1950-300x112.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></p>
<p>The irony is that Britain&#8217;s socialists introduced the NHS into being, yet under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown&#8217;s watch it was destroyed by the introduction of mass unfettered migration from Europe and the Third World, policies that Labour enacted.</p>
<p>By the intense population growth brought on by Labour, there is no room at your GP&#8217;s surgery, no room left in A&amp;E, and no room for urgent medical attention at your local hospital. That&#8217;s because although there has been a large population increase caused by Labour, there has not been the funding, infrastructure change to compensate for the massive speedy increase.</p>
<p>Britain must have immigration, but it must be controlled. This is where the socialists have erred, and this is why they have ruined their own creation &#8212; the NHS.</p>
<p>Healthy, sustainable immigration, where the incoming population is vetted by profession, and integration value is the key to success, unfortunately, Britain has the opposite where most migrants from the poorest parts of Eastern Europe are unskilled, do not work and are a burden on Britain&#8217;s benefits system.</p>
<p>As your relatives lie dying and uncared for on some trolley in a hospital corridor, think on this, somewhere else in the same hospital, a possible NHS tourist or other migratory statistic is taking up their bed and care.</p>
<p>The NHS: created by Labour, and unceremoniously killed off by Labour.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Is he under the table? Is he behind that curtain?&#8221;</p>
<p>Hollywood was up in arms on Thursday when three stars tweeted that <a href="https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/26803-new-reality-show-im-a-celebrity-sex-pest-get-me-in-there.html">Harvey Weinstein</a> was in Los Angeles for the Golden Globes.</p>
<p>Actress Rosanna Arquette on Facebook posted, “It is Very strange, that Harvey Weinstein is at the very same hotel in Beverly Hills that the golden globe press is being done at. I smell a Rat.” She also posted the message on Twitter, though the account @RoArquette is unverified.</p>
<p>That’s when star Ellen Barkin responded from a verified account, “Is serial rapist harvey weinstein in los angeles? on the wknd of the Golden Globes. Why? WHy? WHY?” and also, “I forgot to say “alleged”…because i know better.”</p>
<p>But Weinstein’s reps told rumour mongers of the disgraced movie mogul’s allegedly being in LA, “Harvey Weinstein is everywhere. Up your skirt. Under the bed. In your shoe closet.”</p>
<p>Actresses are now in so much fear that many have to take counselling from professionals at the mere mention of Mr. Weinstein&#8217;s name.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-27033" src="https://cdn-media.httpid.com/c202/2018/01/Celebrity-Reactions-Harvey-Weinstein.png" alt="" width="650" height="483" srcset="https://cdn-media.httpid.com/c202/2018/01/Celebrity-Reactions-Harvey-Weinstein.png 800w, https://cdn-media.httpid.com/c202/2018/01/Celebrity-Reactions-Harvey-Weinstein-300x223.png 300w, https://cdn-media.httpid.com/c202/2018/01/Celebrity-Reactions-Harvey-Weinstein-768x571.png 768w, https://cdn-media.httpid.com/c202/2018/01/Celebrity-Reactions-Harvey-Weinstein-80x60.png 80w, https://cdn-media.httpid.com/c202/2018/01/Celebrity-Reactions-Harvey-Weinstein-265x198.png 265w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;I was coming back from a meal downtown when I passed a dark alley. I saw Weinstein watching me, and when I started running for my limo I heard his footsteps running after me too,&#8221; actress Jennifer Lawrence tweeted on Thursday.</p>
<p>Weinstein has denied sexual assault allegations against him. His reps have repeatedly commented, “Any allegations of nonconsensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein. The actresses who received starring roles in Weinstein brokered movies should be ashamed of themselves for jumping on the wagon.”</p>
<p>A rep for Arquette revealed that Weinstein is &#8220;hiding in plain sight&#8221; and could be &#8220;frickin&#8217; everywhere&#8221;.</p>
<p>“Pulp Fiction” star Arquette is one of a number of actresses who have accused Weinstein of sexual harassment and misconduct. She told some newspaper that her career suffered after she rejected a sexual advance from Weinstein in the early 1990s at the Beverly Hills Hotel where she allegedly attended a sauna session with the mogul in his hotel room.</p>
<p>Her Thursday tweet that Weinstein was allegedly in town was quickly passed around among top Hollywood execs.</p>
<p>Either way, industry pros are on the lookout for the former Miramax mogul. One woman film vet told us, “I was driving in LA and I saw a fat jewish guy get out of a car — and I was like, ‘Stop it, it’s Harvey!’ But it was not. That&#8217;s when I crashed my car injuring three people and killing two.”</p>
<p>Women at this year’s Golden Globes are so freaked out at seeing Weinstein that many are scared to attend the red carpet event just in case he suddenly appears and does something unspeakable to them. Such is the hysteria that some actresses are hiring multiple bodyguards for the event and some are even packing heat, with registered firearms in case Weinstein suddenly jumps out of a tree or comes at them from behind a stage wall or something.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>We have seen the slithering Tony Blair at countless meetings with Jean Claude Juncker and EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier. Mr. Blair flies to Brussels nearly every week to get his latest briefing and orders, and more than likely clandestine brown envelopes filled with much wonga.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can of course transfer to any one of your Swiss accounts,&#8221; a well-suited EU denizen explains to Blair.</p>
<p>Like many of the quislings and treasonous traitors to British interests, the only interest Tony Blair has in the EU Brexit stance is money.</p>
<p>&#8220;The more money Tony makes, the better he feels. He is quite happy to broker deals with Indonesian despots, African tyrants, and crooked Eurocrats all on the take. There is no indignity he will fall to, and betraying the people of Britain is a delight to Blair, he actually gets a kick out of being the Lord Haw Haw of British politics,&#8221; a Westminster commentator revealed.</p>
<p>MPs in Westminster who are actively working to reverse Brexit are all on the EU take, but they don&#8217;t just go for cash payoffs, that would be too vulgar, they instead get their little initiatives boosted where they cream off the money for themselves without anyone else noticing.</p>
<p>Only the devil knows how much Blair is getting for his efforts, but one can be sure that he is not doing all of this for free. Without the Brussels payoffs there would not be much movement from the Blair apart from a few quips here or there. His concerted, well financed campaign screams of Brussels money, much like the other MPs who Remoan on a daily basis in Westminster.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kim Jong-Un knows what he is doing absolutely 110%. According to our intelligence reports, North Korea has a 1.2 million strong army making it the fourth largest in the world, among them more than 100,000 special forces. Although its military hardware dates back to the Soviet era, North Korea has more tanks than the United States (3500 compared with 2381) and more artillery pieces than China.</p>
<p>&#8220;Its nuclear fissile material is enough for at least 20 nuclear weapons, possibly as many as 100, depending on their size. (According to the Arms Control Association, the U.S. has 1411 strategic nuclear warheads.)</p>
<p>&#8220;The recent UN sanctioned oil embargo has not succeeded as <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/12/27/chinese-ships-spotted-satellites-selling-oil-north-korea-30/">Chinese</a> petroleum ships have been photographed at North Korean ports. This Chinese provocation, has also been another problematic variable in the equation. Additionally, Russia has weighed in with threats of siding with North Korea if any conflict were to escalate to conventional warfare, or nuclear.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because North Korea is so exposed, it may resort to nuclear operations as an opening gambit. <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/north-korea-threat-impact-guam-tourism-industry-2018-767849">Guam</a>, or Southern Korean U.S. bases would be the natural target as an opener, to see the reaction of the Trump organisation. If Trump tries to target N. Korean nuclear facilities this intermediate action would further cause an escalation of nuclear proliferation resulting in mass detonations possibly on the Eastern seaboard cities in the United States.</p>
<p>&#8220;With Russia and China siding with Kim Jong-un and in <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/341050-china-russia-alignment-on-north-korea-raises-eyebrows">alignment</a> on the crisis, there may also be further escalation not only with China&#8217;s ambitions on Taiwan, but Russia&#8217;s Ukraine push could go further into Europe, or to former Soviet states within Europe &#8212; Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, and the three Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.</p>
<p>&#8220;Having already encountered skirmishes in 2008, in Eurasian Georgia, Russia has many options into its next move. The worst case scenario of course is an incursion into Poland and Finland. The latter, would be vanquished in less than a day as Putin&#8217;s troops cut through the European peninsula like a knife through butter. Poland recently begged NATO for a <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/us-soldiers-poland-border-russia-trump-nato-584256">more sustained military presence</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Strategically, an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attack on the United States is a plan that would be a serious threat, however N. Korea would not cripple military facilities because they would be protected from EMP. N. Korea would therefore reap the full wrath of a nuclear response from the U.S.</p>
<p>&#8220;The interplay of numerous factions within the geopolitical field during this time, must not dismiss the Iranian threat that could escalate if N. Korea is somehow roused to act, when the U.S. comes down on the isolated communist nation. Although a supposed deal was reached with the Iranian regime to reduce its number of centrifuges by two thirds in 2015, in March 2016, Iran test-fired two Qadr ballistic missiles, and further medium-range tests in January 2017 prompted further sanctions brought on the regime. There is no going back, Iran may have signed a tenuous agreement hailed by former president Obama, but the country has many secret nuclear facilities that are still under operation. This is something that is not being reported by any other public entities.</p>
<p>&#8220;Analysis of major data sets and simulations result in an almighty &#8216;clusterfuck&#8217;. This means that the slightest escalation in any given area, would result in movement not only from the Chinese, but the Russians and Iranians, as well as the North Koreans. This is what we call a hornet&#8217;s nest situation eventually escalating to complete worldwide conventional warfare, concluding with nuclear warfare.</p>
<p>&#8220;The cleanest option is to disarm N. Korea through the use of conventional attack, without China or Russia or Iran moving. Naturally, there would have to be swift movement into the country from air, sea and land immobilising all nuclear facilities before they can be utilised. EMP strikes on North Korea are also an option, and can be simultaneously utilised during the initial strike. By eradicating the high command structure of N. Korea, the people would be leaderless and fall into line almost immediately. The key to completion of this task is clinical planning and implementation without any interference from Russia or China, which is highly unlikely.&#8221;</p>

<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/27002-fake-news-fake-news-fake-news.html">Fake News Fake News Fake News</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.dailysquib.co.uk">Daily Squib</a>.</p>
]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>The year 2017 was the year that the phrase &#8216;fake news&#8217; was brought into the political media circus, a melee of accusatory missives lost in a mire of seditious melancholy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fake news was the term that summed up something yet nothing, because the term itself is fake, it is a catch-all term that can be used for pretty much anything. In our reality, how do we check if anything is real or unreal? Most of the stuff one reads in mainstream media is overclocked journalism, headlines engineered as clickbait, over-exaggeration is the norm in today&#8217;s journalism and is used on a constant basis to attract viewers.  There is very little reality in today&#8217;s journalism where sensationalism is applauded by media editors, and half-truths are presented as whole truths. We now live in a world where a Twitter hashtag can ruin someone&#8217;s career in seconds &#8212; without a trial or jury. All it takes is a few people to spread a rumour utilising a well known Twitter hashtag and the target is almost indefensible. Their lives ruined by rumour and fake news,&#8221; someone of not much importance said at a bus stop today.</p>
<p>Yes, the Russians are inherently evil and are working every day to undermine Western ideals, media, business, but let us look at it this way, were the Russians pushed towards their anti-Western behaviour by the previous American president? Indeed, one could say, Obama was the reason Putin invaded Ukraine, he was also the reason the Russians gave up on playing nice with the West. This is why Vlad started those troll factories churning out anti-establishment propaganda 24 hours a day. Now that Obama is gone, and the friendly Trump is in, maybe East-West relations may simmer down. It is true to say that the Russians could never tolerate a negroid president dictating stuff to them, yet, is it the Russians&#8217; fault that they rarely get to see a black man anyway, how could they respect Obama? The Russian problem, therefore could be put down to racism as a major factor, because outside of the politically correct circles racism does exist, and it always will exist whatever the so-called non-racists say. Racism is a human condition that cannot be controlled or eradicated &#8212; ever.</p>
<p>Fake news, contrary to belief, has of course been around since the dawn of publishing or story telling.</p>
<p>Take one look at the Christian bible to see the biggest load of fake news ever written. It was written by anonymous people just as the old Roman Empire was in major decline and adopted tales from all over the world to incorporate into its story line. Jesus Christ, of which there is no record of him ever living, is the biggest load of fake news ever. Jesus is just a model of every sun god from Krishna to Horus. The Epic of Gilgamesh, an ancient Sumerian cuneiform text reveals that the Noah&#8217;s Ark story is a blatant copy the Christians always seem to brush under the carpet. The point that is trying to be revealed here is that blind faith is a precursor for fake news. Christians blindly believe the conjured up supernatural fairy nonsense in the bible as fact, yet they have no record of backing up the book as reality. This is the biggest fake news story of all time, but yet it is impossible to relate this to a Christian, who has been brainwashed throughout the ages, generationally, traditionally, as part of this certain club. There is no reasoning with anyone who is prepared to blindly believe something purely on faith, because in effect, you could tell them any sort of fake news and they would believe it hook line and sinker. If one transmutes this fake news belief throughout the generations it gets stronger and stronger. This is how fake news becomes almost a reality through belief, yet its foundations are built on a fake swamp of shit.</p>
<p>The key to fake news being believed over and over again is repetition over a long period of time.</p>
<p>In other news, fake news, the term, may have a quieter year in the future, however as a hammer to bang whole organisations on the head with, it is useful to whoever is using it, and whatever their agenda is. No doubt, we will have sporadic episodes of fake news, little vomitous splurges here or there.</p>
<p>The future looks bright, much like the past, the future looks fake.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just when you thought culture, or what&#8217;s left of it can&#8217;t get more fucking banal these money grabbing lazy assholes in the Hollywoodland movie biz are planning on hundreds more superhero movies, however, news is they&#8217;re running out of superheroes to make films of. We are now getting superhero films of superhero groups within superhero groups like mixing Batman with Superman and so on. It&#8217;s getting so tedious that people are getting genuinely pissed off about it. You seen the cinema attendance record lately?&#8221; Aldous Muxley, a cinema critic wrote in his latest newspaper article.</p>
<p><strong>No More Creativity</strong></p>
<p>Superheroes now come in all shapes, races, sexuality and sizes, some being conjured up according to whatever socialist agenda is the taste of the day. We witnessed the resurrection of Wonder Woman for the almighty feminist agenda, and the African Americans are to get their own black Panther superhero to sate the appetite of the angry disenfranchised black cinema going audiences..</p>
<p>What we need now is maybe a Sikh superhero or Chinese one, why do superheroes only have to be black or white, why not a lighter shade of brown or Oriental? Transexual lesbian Filipino superheroes from outer space with five milky breasts under each arm squirting universal teat juice into the eyes of criminals everywhere.</p>
<p>Alien superhero spawn that don&#8217;t even live on planet earth or care about it or look human, they&#8217;re just blobs, green fatty blobs that fly around splatting on the walls or messing up windows with their greasy jello skin?</p>
<p>Insect superheroes, or superhero penguins from Iceland could forge a good global warming warning for the millennial generation.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re coming up with an Eskimo superhero called Igloo. He has shamanic powers and lives in an&#8230;igloo somewhere in the North Pole,&#8221; an elated executive of Warner Bros. recently revealed in Entertainment Weekly.</p>
<p>How about a Hollywood film that has no superheroes? Maybe something with a real plot, real fucking actors and a script that lasts more than the lifecycle of a bargain bin?</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>Kim Jong-Un set up an amazing fireworks show for the people this new year with an amazing explosive extravaganza that wowed everyone.</p>
<p>The 200 megaton explosion flattened much of the capital city, Pyongyang, and spectators were in awe for approximately 2.3 seconds before being vapourised by the bomb.</p>
<p>Dropped directly onto the Juche Tower monument as fervent broadcast announcers ushered in the new year, the explosion was viewed from space by astronauts in the International Space Station.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re having one hell of a new year in North Korea,&#8221; one astronaut quipped whilst sipping vodka from a bag.</p>
<p>Speaking on North Korean state television just before the detonation, Kim Jong-Un spoke utter gibberish and was sporting a floppy cowboy hat with a large peacock feather stuck on the top of it. Frothing at the mouth, he was speedily ushered into his private bunker by senior state officials and army personnel.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the radiation cloud created by the North Korean firework is drifting towards Japan, however scientists say that the Japanese are all irradiated anyway, therefore a little more won&#8217;t hurt.</p>
<p>On hearing of the firework, U.S President, Donald Trump said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I told that boy not to play with fireworks. Looks like he&#8217;s gone and nuked his own capital city. Dang, I wanted to do that, the SOB beat me to it.&#8221;</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>At the moment, there is a vast media push where Remainers, or Remoaners are given a voice to downgrade Britain, to put forward their anti-Brexit agenda, and to derail any form of political progress with the current EU negotiations to leave.</p>
<p>This is a deep-state exit emergency where the media is being utilised to effectively sell Britain down the EU road. When you have councils given the go-ahead to increase tax by 40%, when you have the taxman punishing entrepeneurs who backed Brexit, when you have the media giving Remainers centre stage access to full-page articles to spread their pro-EU bias, you know for certain that this is another wave of attack on Brexit.</p>
<p>The concerted attack on leaving the EU is being conducted from within the British state, and is being directly advised from Brussels.</p>
<p>In days of past when people in government actually cared for Britain and its world-standing, Remainers would have been viewed as traitors or as conducting treason, however, because many have taken large pay-offs from Brussels, they no longer hold allegiance to the UK. It is purely a monetary issue for the Remainers, they are willing to betray their country for money.</p>
<p>For those of you who voted in good faith on June 23, 2016, to leave the EU, unfortunately, the people&#8217;s vote has been sidelined. The opinion of the people is of no value to the traitorous scum Remainers paid off by Brussels. These people are embedded in the highest echelons of all state departments, the media, and orchestrate their agenda with timed precision, backed by the government departments state.</p>
<p>Whitehall, intelligence, BBC, tax, foreign office, treasury, universities, home office, the media.</p>
<p>The people effectively have only one voice, that is the sound of their feet. Referendums do not work because they are counteracted by the controlling body after the vote.</p>
<p>Either there will be another concerted vote by the people (including the silent ones) in the next election, which is now possibly going to be delayed till 2022) that will usher in a true Brexit force, or we have the other option which is the ultimate solution &#8212; complete civil unrest.</p>
<p>Treachery is always eventually punished, especially on those who seek to rob the people. One can only hope for the glorious day when Remainers are given their just desserts for abandoning their country for payoffs from Brussels. These parasites should be given no mercy, their treachery consigned to the lamppost they swing from.</p>

<p>He took five of the eight Grand Slams in those two seasons before injury started to catch up with him towards the end of 2016.</p>
<p>Djokovic has been rarely seen on the court ever since.</p>
<p>However, the Serbian star is set to make his comeback at the Mubadala World Tennis Championships, held in Abu Dhabi.</p>
<p>You can check out <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/tennis/2017/12/27/novak-djokovic-says-elbow-injury-taught-lesson-great-experience/">his thoughts on his comeback covered by the telegraph magazine</a>.</p>
<p>The three-day tournament will be the first time that Djokovic has played since aggravating an elbow injury nearly five months ago.</p>
<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6Ie9vsalp8s" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Crucially, it will give the 12-time Grand Slam winner some much-needed court time before the Australian Open starts on 15th January.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how Djokovic copes with such a little amount of preparation before the event in Melbourne.</p>
<p><strong>Bookies Convinced Djokovic Can Bounce Back</strong></p>
<p>Djokovic is currently ranked as joint-favourite with Roger Federer at 3/1 (Ladbrokes) to win the Australian Open title. This places him just ahead of Rafael Nadal (7/2) and <a href="https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/sports/2120-andy-murray-swallows-tennis-ball-during-final.html">Andy Murray</a> (7/1), who both have suffered injury problems of their own in recent years.</p>
<p>It will be fascinating to see if all four of these players, who have dominated men’s tennis over the last decade, are 100% fit. If so, fans are in for a treat in 2018’s first Grand Slam.</p>
<p>Punters could have a bit of conundrum when picking a winning bet for the Australian Open though, as injury lay-offs mean Djokovic and Murray will not be taking their usual places at the top of the seedings.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, Djokovic is seeded 12th and Murray 16th. This could lead to a potential clash with either Federer or Nadal in the quarter-finals or last 16. It also means there is a chance for a ‘dark horse’ player with big odds making their way to the final. Before betting, check out  <a href="http://www.freebets.co.uk/offers-and-promotions/">http://www.freebets.co.uk/offers-and-promotions/</a> to see if you bag a free tennis bet for the tournament.</p>
<p><strong>Time for Other Players to Step Up</strong></p>
<p>Whether or not Djokovic returns with the same imperious form remains to be seen. However, there is still a chance for other players to really grab their opportunity at the top of the men’s game.</p>
<p>Despite brilliant form in 2017, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal cannot go on at the top forever. The time seems ripe for a couple of new stars to start winning multiple Grand Slams.</p>
<p>One such candidate could be 20-year-old Alexander Zverev. He won two Masters titles in 2017 and qualified for the season-ending ATP World Tennis Finals in November.</p>
<p>The young German has bags of potential, but also respect for the brilliance of legends like Federer. You can read the young man’s thoughts on his future at the <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/atp-world-tour-finals-alexander-zverev-keen-to-learn-from-roger-federer-rafael-nadal-a8050086.html">article about him made by the Independent Magazine</a>.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Ladbrokes have priced him at 11/1 to win the Australian Open.  To do so, he may have to beat a certain Serbian tennis master along the way.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>We are ushered into the inner Sanctum of a Momentum squad building somewhere in deepest Islington, a place where the champagne flows deep and the socialism even deeper.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mind your step!&#8221; a woman in a Greenpeace jumper shouts, as our crew is pushed through narrow corridors going downwards into an inner sanctum that seems endless. The memorabilia on the walls is unmistakable, here we have old Soviet posters urging class struggle, and pictures of Lenin jumping over barricades, and Hezbollah masked men shooting at Jews. These are all recipes for a healthy revolution on a Downing Street that has been governed by the Tories for quite some time now, simply because Labour can&#8217;t be trusted with the purse strings after their massive spending spree under Blair and Brown. The country still has not recovered from Labour&#8217;s economic blitz on Britain&#8217;s coffers, but Corbyn and his crew want to make the ultimate grade this time around.</p>
<p>Suddenly out of nowhere, the bearded one appears, he stands under a single naked bulb swinging erratically. Looking like some sort of Vietcong General, Corbyn ushers us into a tiny room where wall charts plaster every surface.</p>
<p>&#8220;The plan is to get into Number 10 by any means possible. We utilise the young, the naive, the politically infantile who have not seen and experienced what a Labour government is. We will make every promise under the sun to these people and they, not knowing any better, will believe us. Once we are in power, we will spend until the coffers are empty, lose the next election to the Tories who will right the books again, then we will come back for more spending. You see the Tories do not spend, but we do.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Soviet technique of repetition is a well-known method in getting the message across, and this is a Labour favourite.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, repetition, repetition, repetition until the people cannot see anything else? Repeat a lie enough times, and it becomes a truth. This is our technique, and it is a truly tried and tested method that works on the people. The plebs, the people cannot be trusted, this is why it is up to the Politburo to dictate to them what has to be done, what has to be read, what tasks they must do to achieve our approval.&#8221;</p>
<p>What about Theresa May, who seems to be holding on to the reins of power with quite a tight grip?</p>
<p>&#8220;Her position is not assured. If there is another internal leadership squabble, we will go for a General Election call. Our teams up and down the country, our student faculties who all voted twice for me, we are organised, we are determined. You see these socks (pointing to red socks on slippers), these socks will assure me a Number 10 position because they are an assured symbol of my intention, and this is what people need. They want British Rail, they want British Gas, and they want a Royal Mail for the people, not for the companies. I want to travel British Rail and eat a soggy cheese and tomato British Rail fucking sandwich. This is what I want and this is what millions of people who will vote for me want. Get it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Suddenly, out of the darkness one of Momentum&#8217;s rottweiler feminazi mustachioed women comes up behind us, grabs us by the nape of our necks and drags us out through a back entrance. Time is up, and Corbyn has some important preparations to make.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>You will slowly notice that information that used to be accessible before will be either reduced or removed. The smart grid is changing, and now Google will be supreme master of everything without any competition ever again. Sanctioned by the government, information will slowly disappear without trace. Anything that is not sanctioned or created by government will disappear, never to be seen ever again. Anything that is not created by government will be deemed as fake and erased.</p>
<p>History, now all digital, will be easily changed, easily deleted if not useful to the agenda. You won&#8217;t notice it at first, but soon you may search for something and come up with something completely different to what you used to know was real, but in the future, you will not have any reference point any more unless you have the original books, just the answer they serve up to you. Snow is black they will say, and without any reference or detail, the future brainwashed individual will believe it without question.</p>
<p>The Smart Grid, the Internet of Everything will listen to your every conversation, tracks your every move, checks your every motive, and predicts your next move.</p>
<p>Once the cashless grid is brought into fruition, the shutting down of complete human freedom will be possible. It will happen globally in one go, and you will not have a chance to survive or live without the cashless system.</p>
<p>Elements like Twitter and Facebook are already changing the way human&#8217;s think. Human mind processes and linguistics are being simplified, adapted into machine speak, and human behaviour is adapting to the creations these masters over you have created. You are part of the digital mind prison, an echo chamber where you are now completely at their control. To be without Twitter or Facebook now to you is impossible, and it is this thought that means you are now a controlled digital slave, a corporate digital monkey not worthy of being called human any more.</p>
<p>From the digital prison, the Hive Mind is born, and you can already see this in social networks like Twitter and Facebook, where news travels through the hive in concert to its deliverance by the controllers who released whatever it is into the grid. The controllers watch and see how the hive reacts to certain types of information in concert, this way they can be alerted of any danger to their person in real-time, and in predictive-mode.</p>
<p>You will no longer act as an individual, you will no longer have control over your own thoughts, and you will be asleep without noticing as news that is tailored for you is fed to you on a daily basis. The Internet of Things will listen to your every private conversation, your every private action will be logged, and the AI systems in place will monitor and react to your every thought.</p>
<p>Your eventual chipping and full integration into the Matrix Grid will be seemless, and painless because you have been honed, trained and conditioned to accept the grid without question already. There will be little or no resistance as you accept the chip into your brain matter which will fuse into each dendrite.</p>

We’ve all been there.</p>
<p style="clear: both;">Those grand plans of exercising every day and eating healthy food tend to start off so well. Some people even contemplate attempting “Dry January.”</p>
<p>But by the time February hits, the takeaway menus are back out and the gym membership has been swept under a carpet somewhere.</p>
<p>So how can you make a real go of the fitness and dieting in 2018? Check out this guide for some easy tips.</p>
<p><strong>Start Getting Creative in the Kitchen</strong></p>
<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/037irJbCHNw" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Healthy eating and enjoyable eating aren’t often thought about in the same sentence.</p>
<p>Or at least that’s the case for people who haven’t managed to step onto and keep hold of the fitness ladder for more than a few months.</p>
<p>Those who do live a healthy lifestyle and eat the right foods day in, day out, will tell you that <a href="http://www.delish.com/cooking/g1865/healthy-comfort-food/">these dishes have become their comfort foods</a> and they get real pleasure from eating them.</p>
<p>In 2018, there’s no need to say goodbye to the comfort foods that you loved in 2017. According to <a href="https://foodscene.deliveroo.co.uk/cuisine-inspiration/ten-american-dishes-barbecue-burgers-chicken">Deliveroo’s list of popular foods for the soul</a>, American classics like burgers and fries are the most comforting.</p>
<p>These aren’t ideal for your new regime, but there are ways of still enjoying them by using fresh and lean ingredients. You could easily make these foods at home.</p>
<p>For the burgers, grind up some meat with a minimal fat content and season it to your liking before shaping it into patties and grilling it.</p>
<p>Top with fresh lettuce, tomatoes, and goats’ cheese for a healthy burger. When making the fries, chop up some sweet potatoes and cook them in olive oil.</p>
<p>There you have it; some junk food classics revamped for your new way of life.</p>
<p><strong>Get Some Fitness Equipment at Home</strong></p>
<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4pz-7HMMw9U" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/01/this-is-why-you-dont-go-to-the-gym/251332/">Many people fork out on gym memberships in January</a> and, when the motivation diminishes a few months later, they fail to get their money’s worth.</p>
<p>For some, just biting the bullet and going to the gym on a daily basis is the major stumbling block, and if they were there they would find it easy to get into the zone.</p>
<p>So how about bringing the gym to you? The price that some fitness centres charge these days is a small fortune, so using that money to buy fitness equipment for your own home could be a logical alternative.</p>
<p>Seeing the treadmill or rowing machine will remind you to work out, and you could even do it while watching your favourite shows on TV.</p>
<p>Another added bonus is the fact that you won’t have to share the space with all the self-obsessed selfie-takers usually found in gyms.</p>
<p>Getting into shape this New Year will take some motivation, but if you get into good habits at home then it will be easier to maintain.</p>
<p>And also, if you fork out money on gym equipment you don’t want it to end up gathering dust.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>Oh yeah, there is a new Star Wars film doing the rounds, but it is so crap and unmemorable that we actually forgot to write up a review of it.</p>
<p>The film is a mismatch of different scenes plonked onto one stale piece of moribund shit, that is frankly a disservice to any Star Wars fan, or anyone who watches any type of film for that matter. The funny thing is it&#8217;s not a film because it does not really have a storyline or plot but sort of meanders along with little battle scenes plonked in every few minutes.</p>
<p>Snoke, a deadly Sith lord, who is supposed to be very powerful, is chopped in half by a wayward lightsaber accident within the first few minutes of encountering him. Such a terrible waste, not only of Siths but of action scenes. Obviously the film-makers were way too lazy to bother having a full-on fight with a Sith lord, instead he gets chopped in half like some pathetic piece of mutton in a Halal butcher&#8217;s shop down in Leytonstone on a Saturday afternoon.</p>
<p>The rest of the film is too stupid and boring to even mention. Luke Skywalker is a miserable old fart who is found on a Scottish island milking odd prosthetic plastic creatures&#8217; fleshy teats and fishing with a long pole. Finn is the token black bloke in space who always looks surprised  and sweaty in a space suit. Princess Leia, in reality was so coked up on drugs she did not know where the fuck she was, and this showed in the film as she stumbles from one scene to another looking like a Hollywood botox casualty on multiple lines snorted from the star ship&#8217;s dashboard. The female heroine of the film, has her hair pulled so far back on her head that she resembles a Croydon chavette in space. The only thing missing is a pair of hoop earrings, a crying baby and a fucking tracksuit.</p>
<p>Kylo Ren, or whatever his name is as well as his sidekick are spoiled little brats having tantrums in space. It&#8217;s one tantrum after another, as they fling pieces of lego around the set.</p>
<p>The finale, with a teleported astral vision of Luke doing a walkabout is the only bit worthy of the whole film. That is it. The rest of it is absolute bollocks. Oh, one last mention, the crimson red background and Elite Praetorian Samurai-esque guards for Snoke were pretty cool..that&#8217;s it though..</p>
<p>Star Wars used to be something special. Those days are all gone. Now it is something resembling Harry Potter or some other cutesy Hollywood crud that is simply a vehicle for some new director to establish himself in the biz. The formulaic nature of the new Star Wars films skimps on introducing new characters, new innovations and new story lines instead delving into a tired old soap opera consisting of just a few mediocre characters following each other around in space in an endless circle.</p>
<p>It is probably too late but if you are going to see this film, do not pay for it, because this would encourage more of its ilk to be made. Simply go onto the many streaming services on the net and watch it for free in full HD.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap" style="background-color: #333333;">A</span>mongst the squabbling caterwauling ingrates of parliament, the treasonous swine Remoaning shit barnacles, and the ever appeasing Remoaner Theresa May &#8212; if there is no real Brexit, then the people will simply take the quarrel to the streets with a little bit of required civil unrest, and all that sort of stuff.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will make the Poll Tax riots look like an evening tea party at the vicarage. We&#8217;re talking every town, every city in Britain burning from the inside out.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re talking Remoaners being lynched on lamp posts, burned in their cars, beaten to death by mobs of angered citizens who have just about had enough.</p>
<p><strong>As for the duration of the riots?</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re talking ten to thirty years of civil unrest, in which anarchy, chaos and mayhem will rule,&#8221; a real Brexiteer revealed today whilst reminiscing on the past year of absolute nonsense from the Cabinet.</p>
<p><strong>How much more delay can the people take?</strong></p>
<p>They want out of the ECJ, out of the single market, and to take complete charge of the borders. That is not too much to ask is it?</p>
<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C8ExtMRknAQ" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yet, we are now saddled with Alignment, with Interim Periods, with ECJ diktats ongoing, with delay after delay and a 100 Billion euro fine to be paid because our numpty PM, Theresa May who could not bargain her way out of a paper bag, has gone and messed everything up.</p>
<p>Here is a woman with absolutely no authority over anyone, let alone her own party, which seems to be overrun by snivelling Marxist EU robots intent on keeping Britain inside the dysfunctional crumbling EU.</p>
<p>Over 100,000 people have signed a petition to <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/200165">Leave the EU Immediately.</a> There is no doubt that even after acquiring over 100,000 signatures, it is guaranteed that this petition and its contents will be swept under a convenient rug somewhere never to be heard of ever again. Unfortunately, this is the very reason that direct action is the only solution.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em>The Government should walk away from the Article 50 negotiations and leave the EU immediately with no deal. The EU looks set to offer us a punishment deal out of spite. Why wait another 18 months when we could leave right away and fully take back control of our country, lawmaking powers and borders?</em></p>
<p><strong>Riots, Looting, Anarchy and Chaos</strong></p>
<p>Let us examine for one second how the riots would kick off, there would be sporadic clashes here or there, maybe Nottingham, maybe some in the Midlands, then further South, towards Devon, then North up Manchester and Liverpool way, then London. The police will stand down, simply because they have had their resources scuppered by Theresa May. They don&#8217;t want to get hurt for no pay. Who does?</p>
<p>The anger built up by over years of dilly dallying over Brexit is already reaching a crescendo, but what will tip the scale into rioting is the major capitulation to Brussels by Theresa May and her Remoaner Chancellor, Philip Hammond, who are engineering a sneaky weak Brexit which will keep Britain in the EU forever.</p>
<p><strong>Civil War</strong></p>
<p>The last English Civil War, 1642-1651, was fought mainly over religious grounds, and it seems the Catholic EU and Protestant English Brexiteers are not all too different from their ancestors in their hatred of each other.</p>
<p>The next English Civil War, might not even be remembered&#8230;especially if it&#8217;s the last&#8230;</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>March’s meeting signals the pinnacle of National Hunt racing as the best horses, jockeys and trainers head to Prestbury Park for the famous four-day event.</p>
<p>If nothing else, you can guarantee a dramatic week of intense racing action.</p>
<p>Check out our thoughts on a few of the most prestigious races at the Festival…</p>
<p><strong>Supreme Novices Hurdle</strong></p>
<p>Look no further than MENGLI KHAN here.</p>
<p>Gordon Elliott had a superb Festival in 2017 and he can get next year’s edition off to the perfect start with a winner in the first.</p>
<p>Having <a href="https://www.independent.ie/sport/horse-racing/watch-gordon-elliotts-mengli-khan-adds-to-growing-reputation-with-royal-bond-success-36374468.html">won his last three races relatively comfortably</a>, Mengli Khan can add a Cheltenham win to his list in the coming months.</p>
<p>SAMCRO, also trained by Elliott, is likely to feature at the Festival but could be aimed at a<br />
different race given Mengli Khan’s achievements thus far. Barring a major injury, he will be<br />
very difficult to beat.</p>
<p><strong>Arkle Chase</strong></p>
<p>A wide-open affair. FOOTPAD has attracted plenty of betting attention in ante-post markets<br />
and with good reason. He won convincingly over two miles, one furlong at Navan last time<br />
out and has the quality to defeat his rivals here.</p>
<p>SCEAU ROYAL emerged victorious at the Henry VIII Novices’ Chase at Sandown this month and he may be the main danger.</p>
<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hYw_JhnjNgY" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NORTH HILL HARVEY, trained by Dan Skelton, is something of a course specialist and he<br />
will relish any conditions. Come rain or shine, he will be there or thereabouts and this could<br />
be the highlight of the first day’s racing.</p>
<p><strong>Champion Hurdle</strong></p>
<p>Doubts over FAUGHEEN’s presence in the race may tempt punters to look elsewhere in the<br />
betting markets. If he runs, the Rich Ricci-owned superstar will be the one to beat – he was<br />
dominant when winning at Punchestown on his comeback in November.</p>
<p>BUVEUR D’AIR will not relinquish his crown easily though; the defending champion will be in the mix.</p>
<p>DEFI DU SEUIL is an interesting candidate here. He was disappointing on his seasonal<br />
debut at Ascot when odds-on but should bounce back. If targeted for this race, he could<br />
feature prominently. Still a very cloudy race as we approach Christmas…</p>
<p><strong>RSA Chase </strong></p>
<p>PRESENTING PERCY won well at the 2017 Festival but has been a bit of a mixed bag in<br />
recent months. He was impressive when winning at Fairyhouse at the start of December<br />
though and should go close on that form. An 8/1 shot at the time of writing, he will feature in <a href="https://www.timeform.com/horse-racing/tips">tips at Timeform</a> in the coming months.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, this could be a target for DEATH DUTY. He was travelling nicely when unseating his rider in the Albert Bartlett Novices’ Hurdle earlier this year and could make up<br />
for that mistake. A convincing winner in his last three races, he has proven himself in Grade One company and could be the one to beat.</p>
<p><strong>Queen Mother Champion Chase </strong></p>
<p>News of DOUVAN’s injury shocked the racing world earlier this month and MIN may fly the<br />
flag for the Willie Mullins camp in this race. Yet to win a race at the Festival, the 2016<br />
Supreme Novices’ runner-up has won three out of three since. He will be tough to stop if Mullins gets him to the peak of his powers.</p>
<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ur1CdC50UZU" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ALTIOR will head the betting for this race – and it is easy to see why. Nicky Henderson has a real diamond on his hands and he could have the beating of Min again here. It is difficult to back against Altior given his achievements but Tingle Creek winner POLITOLOGUE must<br />
be respected for Paul Nicholls.</p>
<p><strong>JLT Novices Chase</strong></p>
<p>DEATH DUTY features prominently in the betting for this race too – and Elliott may be<br />
more inclined to target the JLT. But he may have to go up against the well-fancied</p>
<p>FINIAN’S OSCAR and that is no easy task. The Colin Tizzard-trained star missed the 2017 Festival but has won at Cheltenham before and should go close.</p>
<p>Another horse not getting as much respect as he maybe deserves is WILLOUGHBY COURT.</p>
<p>A convincing winner at Newbury last time out, he is a general 8/1 shot to win the JLT and it<br />
wouldn’t be a huge surprise to see him claim a sixth successive victory at the Festival.</p>
<p><strong>Ryanair Chase </strong></p>
<p>One of the highlights of the Festival. UN DE SCEAUX will probably start as favourite but he<br />
won’t be too far ahead of FOX NORTON in the betting. Both horses are capable of winning<br />
at Grade One level and punters will be eagerly anticipating what could be a classic head to<br />
head contest.</p>
<p>Outside of the top two, the enigmatic YORKHILL may go close if he is aimed at this race.<br />
He is probably going to go elsewhere but should be respected. TOP NOTCH is another who<br />
is likely to feature in a different race although it wouldn’t be a massive surprise if he gets an entry either…</p>
<p><strong>Stayers Hurdle </strong></p>
<p>NICHOLS CANYON was a <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/horse-racing/nicholas-canyon-wins-stayers-hurdle-10039851">superb winner of this race in 2017</a> and a second successive win<br />
over the longer distance could be on the cards. Since winning the Stayers Hurdle, he has lost by a short head to rival UNOWHATIMEANHARRY and by nine lengths to the impressive<br />
APPLE’S JADE last time out – both are near the top of the markets for this race.</p>
<p>Whilst the latter may be aimed at the Mares Hurdle, the former will almost certainly head to Cheltenham. He was a short-priced favourite for this year’s renewal but struggled to keep pace when the going got tough. Nichols Canyon isn’t invincible but he will take some<br />
beating here as he is arguably the class horse in the field.</p>
<p><strong>Cheltenham Gold Cup </strong></p>
<p>After four days of fantastic racing action, it all boils down to this: the Gold Cup. One of the<br />
most prestigious races in the industry, this is the one that everybody wants to win and 2017 winner SIZING JOHN will be the one to beat. He is one of the most exciting horses to watch on current form and should go close once again.</p>
<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ht7ksrnjWSI" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center>MIGHT BITE loves it around Cheltenham though and deserves his spot near the top of the<br />
betting markets. Henderson believes that he is one of the most talented horses that he has<br />
ever worked with and you’d have to make him right on talent alone. YORKHILL and Betfair<br />
Chase winner BRISTOL DE MAI also deserve a hat tip in what could be a memorable race.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>Theresa May was in Brussels on Thursday night for the start of a two-day European Council summit at which she was applauded by leaders of the other 27 member states for her speech over dinner where she outlined every detail of capitulating to the EU&#8217;s demands.</p>
<p>She told them that she wanted to approach the remaining stages of EU withdrawal with her usual stance of cowardice, weakness and surrender.</p>
<p>Mrs May insisted that she wanted to move onto the next phase of negotiations and approach it “with absolute disdain for Britain and the EU referendum result”.</p>
<p>She said: “A particular priority should be agreement on the two year implementation period so that we will not be allowed to make any trade deals with anyone, will still be ruled completely by Brussels and will still be paying  £395 million per week to Brussels in addition to the 100 Billion Euro ransom demand which I agreed to pay without even a fight.”</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said she &#8220;makes no secret of wanting to move on to the next phase of the soft-Brexit and to approaching it with utter surrender and cowardice&#8221;, adding: &#8220;I believe this is in the best interest of the UK, but then again I am a deluded old barren hag who is so naive that I agree to anything without question.</p>
<p>&#8220;A particular priority should be agreement on the two year implementation period so that cash cow Britain can get sucked dry of more cash that will go into the EU sinkhole.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Too Easy</strong></p>
<p>As he arrived for the second day of the summit, Jean-Claude Juncker, the jubilant European President, said:</p>
<p>&#8220;The second phase of rogering the British swine, and taking the clueless Mrs. May for a ride is considerably easier than the first, and the first was very easy. If I wanted to I could sell Mrs. May a pink elephant and she would agree to part with billions for it. She really is that naive.&#8221;</p>
<figure id="attachment_26859" style="max-width: 620px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-26859" src="https://cdn-media.httpid.com/c202/2017/12/Donkey-Britain-Brexit-e1513337621425.png" alt="Donkey Britain Brexit" width="620" height="484" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Theresa May&#8217;s Remainer Brexit Britain &#8212; Not even fit for the knackers yard</figcaption></figure>
<p>The Commission president said that EU leaders applauded Mrs May on Thursday &#8220;because some of us thought, including me, that the easy way she bent over the desk for all of us to take turns on her was unbridled. I mean it was like a scene from Hubert Selby, Jr.&#8217;s novel Last Exit to Brooklyn, that gritty.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Juncker said that the Withdrawal Agreement now needed to be formalised and placed before the European Parliament, adding:</p>
<p>&#8220;I withdrew, then the other chap, then the other chap. We were sated. The British are too easy to swing, their women looser than even the French.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked whether he thought the UK may reverse its decision to leave, Mr Juncker said:</p>
<p>&#8220;That depends on the quislings in the British Parliament and the Marxist section of the British people. It&#8217;s not up to us to decide what the British people want, but our Project Fear campaigns have been very successful, and our spies in the British parliament who work with Remainer quisling MPs are always finding new ways to destroy any form of Brexit that was voted for on June 23, 2016.&#8221;</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>Nothing sickens the palate more than to see a seemingly eloquent politician moaning about something he has stood back from and watched from afar.</p>
<p>Cue, Nigel Farage, a man whose vision and sheer will power made the administration of former PM David Cameron agree to a Referendum on whether Britain should stay or leave the EU.</p>
<p>If it was not for Nigel Farage there would never have been a referendum, and never a vote to leave on June 23, 2016.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the referendum was the beginning, yet, instead, Mr. Farage abandoned his party, and went on walkabout. Yes, he is an MEP, however he has not had an instrumental role in the Brexit since June 23, 2016, where it all ended for him.</p>
<p>Now that we have the massive <a href="https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/26878-triumphant-theresa-may-delivers-non-brexit.html">capitulation</a> to every Brussels demand by current Tory PM, Theresa May, who has effectively tied the UK to the EU until 2021, and beyond with the ECJ diktats. What is Farage doing?</p>
<p>Farage is still out of the loop and moaning about the terrible deal <a href="https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/26811-bad-deal-weak-theresa-may-pay-eu-ransom-100-billion-euros.html">Theresa May</a> has given, in which Remainers are jubilant about.</p>
<p>First off Mr. Farage, what the fuck did you expect? We have a Remainer PM, a Remainer Cabinet and a Remainer Chancellor. What the hell do you expect them to do? In no uncertain terms, it is only natural that they appease Brussels simply because they do not want a Brexit and never have. Where are you Mr. Farage? Where the fuck are you?</p>
<p>Talking on LBC? WHAT&#8217;S THAT GOING TO DO? You guessed it, absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>The only course we can see is that you come back to Blighty, either start a new party or re-join UKIP. That is the only way you can save Britain, and you better do it sharpish because things are getting worse and worse every day.</p>
<p>Because of Theresa May, the Tory party has failed Britain immensely and are stained beyond repair. Another party has to come and clean house.</p>
<p>So, Mr. Farage, undoubtedly you will never read this, but stop faffing around and watching the boat go by, because soon it will be too late for any action.</p>
<p>The next General Election will be held in 2020 or earlier, this will be the final say on Brexit, and the so-called Conservatives will lose at the rate they are going.</p>
<p>We are now on a war footing, this is war, this is combat, this is it..</p>
<p>DO IT! You must do this now because no one else will.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Writing on Twitter where the president reveals most of his enlightened brain farts, he declared the book &#8211; <strong><em><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/FAKE-NEWS-Strange-historical-reimagined-ebook/dp/B0765N7DD7">FAKE NEWS: Strange historical facts reimagined in the world of Donald Trump </a></em></strong>as a load of &#8216;Fake news worthy of CNN&#8217;.</p>
<p>The book written by up-and-coming author <a href="http://davidhutter.net/">David Hutter</a> includes some great stuff about Keef Richards, mad vikings, Gaius Caligula, King Pep II from 2284BC, and killer rabbits that chomp on fingers and other appendages that may be in the way.</p>
<p>Exploring the shallow depths of the president&#8217;s mind, this book will have you rolling along the floor swearing like some kind of obscene parrot at a Kim Jong Un celebration prior to an imminent nuclear attack on Washington D.C.</p>
<p>What else can we say, it is a thoroughly enjoyable read, and anyone who likes strange facts peppered here or there will assuredly be satisfied, much like Donald is when he releases his daily Twitter illumination.</p>
<p>Buy the book at a very <a href="http://davidhutter.net/books/">reasonable price</a> before Trump has the lot incinerated.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>Millenials, the New Puritans, do not like to have fun, do not have sex, do not drink, do not do drugs, do not swear, and do not condone free speech. Instead, these miserable excuses for human beings prefer to stay in their safe spaces and display their outrage of anything masculine or fun from the safety of their couches on Twitter. This applies to male, female, transgender, cis, non binary or whatever Millenials.</p>
<p>Naturally, this puritanical behaviour is backed up by the left-leaning social networks and the major media networks in America, as well as the BBC in Britain. Google, for example, which went from an all encompassing, all accepting entity during the early years of the net, is now a pseudo-Orwellian Marxist puritanical anti free-speech, anti-art PC monstrosity that dictates puritanical leftist rules to everyone through its octopus grip over the whole internet.</p>
<p><strong>Soviet SJW Puritan Cancer</strong></p>
<p>The puritanical behaviour is mostly seen in the rise of Third Wave Feminism, which is an extreme level of hatred of men. What we are seeing here is not a push for equality, but for superiority over men, and in most cases, the complete emasculation and eradication of men from this earth.</p>
<p>The demonisation of anything masculine, behavioural or otherwise, is seen in the daily, weekly, monthly witch hunts against men. Of course there are some men who have genuinely behaved badly, however when it gets to tarring every man with the same brush, where every action a man does is scrutinised analysed, then condemned, we are reaching impossible levels of feminism that completely abhors anything a man does and actively encourages  emasculation inciting back lashes, and possible civil unrest.</p>
<p>The utterly boring banal selfie-taking narcissistic lives of these puritans is a terrible vision of not only our immediate future as a race but a terrifying glimpse into the far future.</p>
<p>Eventually the puritan Millenials will be the generation running the show, and in 30-40 years time, life on earth will be even more of a puritanical nightmare. One can imagine these emotionless, sexless, characterless Googlebot android people roaming the streets looking for anyone who is happy and is having fun. Their microchipped brains linked to the hive mind, they analyse your every feature, your social network past, and your private details before making a decision and marching you off to a Google/Facebook reconditioning camp.</p>
<p>These are people bereft of any life, of any soul, and they have no idea about freedom, privacy or just having a good fucking time. These soulless sad people will live and die an empty life without having experienced one percent of what life could offer, they are walking corpses, cancerous tumours upon humanity, they are awful pitiful creatures who can only be cured by a bullet in the head, such is the level of their Marxist programming.</p>

<p>The weak, ineffectual, incompetent corpse of Theresa May is still barely walking the hallowed halls of the House of Commons and Number 10, but for how long? Can the country take any more incompetence, disregard for Brexit, and utter complacency to the serious issues of the country.</p>
<p>The blundering mess of May, especially when dealing with the Priti Patel affair proves to many how weak May&#8217;s position is, and how the crumbling edifice of her prime-ministership is sinking into the mire daily.</p>
<p>Gone before Christmas, these are the whispers heard in the dark halls of Westminster and in the drinking holes. May&#8217;s biggest mistake was appointing Hammond as Chancellor of the Exchequer and the myriad of waffling statements she has made about her vision of a watered down Brexit which would actually not be a Brexit if she had it her way.</p>
<p>As the knives go in to carve up the Christmas turkey of Theresa May, there will be squeals of delight and anticipation by the dinner table as everyone asks &#8216;what happens next?&#8217;.</p>
<p>One can only hope that a competent former Mayor of London, keen cyclist and latin orator takes the helm of the ship and lets it set sail to the true promised land. Aut Caesar aut nihil.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>Apparently Pretty Priti Patel is about to be sacked by Theresa May because of some weird mix up over talking to the Israelis.</p>
<p>Surely this cannot be so? It is quite clear that Priti Patel, a very capable MP and Vote Leave campaigner should not get the sack because she was told to keep the information hush hush by the peeps up on high, and she was just pandering to their wishes.</p>
<p>The main reason for not sacking Pretty Patel is because she is quite the pretty one, and to lose such prettiness from the Cabinet would be sad to say the least.</p>
<p>She looks pretty here, she looks pretty there, and there should be more pretty female MPs, but under the current PC climate, one must not dare go any further, and even calling Priti Patel pretty could get one in all sorts of trouble.</p>
<p>So, to concisely put the point forward, please do not sack pretty Priti Patel, with those perfect pretty dimpled cheeks, and her perfect pretty face, because she is in the words of Larry David, &#8216;pretty, pretty, good&#8217;.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;The airborne pneumonic plague which erupted in Madagascar is now spreading onto nine African countries through air traffic. What is a breath of stale air of death for the overpopulated regions it spreads to is a breath of fresh air for the planet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Human overpopulation is a serious problem that has to be controlled, because over breeding causes devastation to whole regions of the earth, kills off finite resources, creates massive poverty, conflict, misery and immense amounts of pollution.</p>
<p><strong>Exponential Increase</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Already the human population of the earth is 7.6 billion and rising. This is not sustainable for the planet, and ultimately the human race. Overpopulation reduces the planet&#8217;s ability to host such numbers, and the human population rising will eventually create all out war as resources diminish further.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16276" src="https://cdn-media.httpid.com/c202/2015/12/Overpopulation_1677834c.jpg" alt="Overpopulation" width="460" height="288" srcset="https://cdn-media.httpid.com/c202/2015/12/Overpopulation_1677834c.jpg 460w, https://cdn-media.httpid.com/c202/2015/12/Overpopulation_1677834c-300x188.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;The population of China is currently 1.379 billion, and of India 1.324, and of the African continent 1.216 billion. These are the areas where the most waste is created and an incurable airborne plague spreading through air and sea traffic would solve much of the earth&#8217;s problems. However, even this would be too little too late, as the eradication would have to reach over 90% of the earth&#8217;s population for humans to exist in a peaceful, sustainable environment and respect what is left of the earth&#8217;s remaining resources.</p>
<p>&#8220;Diseases like AIDS have had minimal impact on the earth&#8217;s population, however an airborne incurable medicine to overpopulation could be the answer mother nature has been wishing on for some time.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16277" src="https://cdn-media.httpid.com/c202/2015/12/Surpopulation-Afrique.jpg" alt="Surpopulation" width="460" height="276" srcset="https://cdn-media.httpid.com/c202/2015/12/Surpopulation-Afrique.jpg 460w, https://cdn-media.httpid.com/c202/2015/12/Surpopulation-Afrique-300x180.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px" /></p>
<p><strong>What happens afterwards?</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;The surviving governing global authority must make sure that all breeding is heavily controlled from then on so that this mess can never be allowed to happen again. Responsibility will be the key. We are already in a Malthusian nightmare of grotesque proportions which makes most of the globe almost ungovernable and destined for serious ecological destruction. Little Prince Wills is correct in his summation.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-23689" src="https://cdn-media.httpid.com/c202/files//overpopulation360_503390964-300x233.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="233" /></p>
<p>&#8220;This is why an all encompassing solution like the airborne black plague is a breath of fresh air for mother nature, as she creates, she can also take back if she has been abused, and certainly over the last century or so, mother nature has been ripped and shredded from her mantle.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no cause for alarm amongst the populations, they should be fed their diet of game shows, Facebook and smart phones. They should not be aware of what is happening until it is too late, and by then there will be no easing of urgency of the project and the process at hand.&#8221;</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>What do the Las Vegas mass shooting and Dallas church massacre have in common?</p>
<p>Well, the target of the Vegas shooting was a Country music audience, white, Christians and most probably American patriots who support their president. The target for the Dallas church massacre were white, Christians, most probably American patriots who support their president. Both of these targets supported Donald Trump, because American Liberals do not attend Country music festivals. As for the church massacre, staunch Christians attending church were most probably all Republican voting Trump supporters. You would never catch a liberal praising Jesus in a Texas church wearing a Stetson and chewing on a piece of tobacco.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the crux of the matter. It&#8217;s right there in plain sight to see. There is definitely a pattern developing here. We have two incidents where right wing white Christian Trump voters were targeted, and the funny thing is no one in the media is mentioning any correlation to these two incidents. In fact, everything about these mass murders is being kept under the radar. My theory is that if the militias get fired up that their kind is now a target by these left leaning shooters, they might start fighting back, and the government does not want a full scale civil war on their hands,&#8221; Joe Bloom, a crime analyst revealed on Tuesday.</p>
<p>We all know what a fractured nation America is right now, and this thought also extends towards the internal government where every day another fracture develops.</p>
<p>The question is who will be the next target for mass shooting? The Las Vegas shooter killed 58 Trump supporters and injured 546. The Texas shooter killed 26 Trump supporters.</p>
<p>We shall have to see what happens in the future, and decide whether there is further correlation to the previous mass shootings. The Vegas shooting occurred on 1 October, and the Texas church massacre occurred on November 5. Both these shootings are at the beginning of the month, and one suspects the Texas shooter specifically chose 5 November (Guy Fawkes night) for a very specific reason.</p>
<p>The next mass shooting is therefore probably going to occur between December 1-5 if the pattern is correct. The targets will be Trump voters, white, Christian, American patriots.</p>
<p>The only thing to address is where? Both of these shooters in Vegas and Texas were lone wolves who came out of nowhere. There are absolutely no clues apart from a dedicated target of Trump supporters. Could be in any state, any county, any town across America.</p>
<p>We will relate back to this article after the next shooting occurs.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>The revelations that the super-rich hold their precious millions/billions off shore, is not exactly new news, however the recent uncovering of the Paradise Papers reveals one important fact, the socialists and Marxists are working overtime to defrock those on the the other side of the political spectrum i.e. the Right.</p>
<p>We have seen a serious leftist agenda at work with the rise of political correctness and Third Wave feminism in the last few months, leaving a landscape where merely touching a woman, even by accident or pecking a woman on the cheek can be construed as sexual harassment or even rape. This feminist push is not about sexual harassment but about power over the patriarchy, and the destruction of men in the workplace as well as in society. It is being orchestrated by the myriad of leftist communist groups under the scenes, and of course by large behemoth socialist monsters like George Soros and his Open Society.</p>
<p>How can we not have a discussion on communist Marxist groups without of course mentioning Antifa, which as a nihilist organisation claims to care about racism and fascism, when in reality, their actions are racist and fascistic in tone. Their role has been mostly violent, and the department of Homeland Security recently labelled them as <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4844296/Homeland-Security-deem-antifa-domestic-terrorists.html">domestic terrorists</a>. Many of the hierarchy within the Antifa group have even travelled to Kurdish controlled Syria to train in guerilla tactics and terrorism of course funded by Soros and his counterparts.</p>
<p>The leftist groups leading the march against the conservatives in Britain, and Trump in America are not only proponents of violent behaviour but also do not eschew the tenets of free speech or democracy. Their only wish is for violent revolution and the death of leaders like Donald Trump. We can see this on Twitter where death threats against Donald Trump are celebrated and the users not banned, however if a conservative writes something, their account is immediately banned and they are erased from Twitter. There is also proof that Google, still mourning the loss of their beloved Obama, gives carte blanche to leftist communist groups to air their views, yet anyone else is sent to page 2,000 of the search.</p>
<p>What is truly mystifying though is that even though the Conservatives are in so-called power in the UK, and that Donald Trump is supposedly in power in the United States, the leftist communist agenda is breaking through everything, and is even being adopted by the people in power today. This sort of insurgency brings one to the conclusion that there is major Deep State help for the communists, and that the Marxists have some important friends behind closed doors pulling the necessary strings.</p>
<p>The leftist command over all media must be commended, for it has even infiltrated the likes of the Daily Telegraph where daily articles are spewed out from a coterie of anti-male feminist writers whose sole role is to diminish men and promote female supremacy over the male. These writers, have no place in the Daily Telegraph, and to read the vitriolic anger against their articles is to witness how angry men are getting every day. For how long can this denigration of everything male go on before society breaks up completely and war starts?</p>
<p><strong>Triggered</strong></p>
<p>The subject of war, yes, total and utter all out fucking war, will probably be the only equalising state this world needs right now. With a war, many of the leftists who are weak, will die as they are not as strong as the right. All the feminists will be purged and killed off, and all the <a href="http://www.dailywire.com/news/22906/buzzfeed-guys-test-their-testosterone-levels-amanda-prestigiacomo">low-testosterone socialists</a> will meet an unsavoury end because they cannot fight in an effective manner. Snowflakes, safe spaces, SJWs, triggered bull-dykes, trannies, the constantly whinging left will be completely eradicated, the poseur Marxists a la Russell Brand will be lynched on the first day and their champagne socialist heads displayed for the ravens to pick at in the midday sun. All of these couch potatoes and their internet blogs will mean nothing when they are forced down on their knees and their non binary cis gender heads unceremoniously blown off into the gutters streaming with blood.</p>
<p>This is where the socialists want to go, and they are doing their best to engender war, internal war, not only here in the UK, but across the pond in America. This is possibly masochism on their part, their extreme self-hatred will eventually implode, and they will be exterminated without prejudice, because at the end of the day, they are weak, they are not trained in war, they are not trained in effective survival, and they have little or no understanding of the ultimate chaos of war or how to be prepared for it. If this is what they want, then this is what they will get.</p>
<p>Bring it on.</p>

<p>Starring Dustin Hoffman as Dirty Focker, Kevin Spacey as Pedo Focker, and Harvey Weinstein as Rapey Monster Focker, this time around, Bobby Deniro, Stiller and Barbara Streisand took a rain check on the ill-fated project.</p>
<p>As far as the plot for the film goes, without giving away too many spoilers, there&#8217;s a lot of sickness in this film that will have you reaching for the puke bag more than the pop corn.</p>
<p>The film is about three Focker brothers who use their power in Hollywood to do horrible deeds.</p>
<p>Producer and actor in the project, Harvey Weinstein came out of hiding to talk about his role: &#8220;I do a lot of focking. I even Fock plant pots. Like I fock this actress after I promised her a role in this movie, but once I did the focking, I forgot her name, but she sure as hell remembered mine. It was consensual, at least that is what I heard above the screaming.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pedo Focker, Kevin Spacey reveals in the LA Times that his role was highly enjoyable because there was no come-back for his evil actions, unlike in real life when the truth finally reared its ugly head.</p>
<p><strong>The Usual Suspects</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;The test screenings went well. People would flee the theatre crying uncontrollably and many were so distressed they needed counselling on a long term basis. Out of all the Fockers I&#8217;d say in terms of evil, it was up against Weinstein Focker and Spacey Focker,&#8221; the director of the film, Roman Polanski revealed from Croatia.</p>

<p>&#8220;One has taken the opportunity to connect with ones subjects in Great Britain and the common people worldwide, by opening ones very own personal Facebook account under the profile name ‘queen’.</p>
<p>&#8220;One decided to increase ones popularity by being over-complimentary. One of my Facebook ‘friends’ posted a picture of their dog on their timeline, so I typed the comment ‘ah too cute for words’. The owner of the dog was delighted with ones admiration for their pet, even though the filthy fat creature was so ugly one wasn’t sure if one was looking at its face or its actual asshole.</p>
<p>&#8220;One also credited one of ones friends’ children’s achievements. They posted the good news that their kids had passed the twelve yard swimming test, so I typed the over-congratulatory comment ‘well done little angels, you’re so brave, you’ll be swimming the English channel soon.&#8217; This phoney gesture pleased ones ‘friend’, though one couldn’t give a rat’s ass about someone else’s kid’s swimming test. One has actually fallen further than twelve yards down the palace stairs after a night on the gin.</p>
<p>&#8220;One posted one of those ready-made pearls of wisdom quotes on my timeline. It said ‘love hurts, but unless you truly realise the pain of love you will never appreciate what love is’. Utter shit of course, but it gained one some ‘likes’ on ones timeline.</p>
<p>&#8220;One tried to appear helpful to the Facebook readers. One of my ‘friends’ posted a request on their timeline ‘does anybody have a spare lawn mower I can use? &#8211; mine’s broken’. One responded with the seemingly heroic but completely useless gesture (which is prevalent on Facebook) &#8211; ‘well I know a clay pigeon shooter in Scotland whose brother owns a large pair of tweezers &#8211; if that’s any help?’.&#8221;</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap" style="background-color: #333333;">S</span>peaking in the House of Commons today, Mrs. May unveiled a new scheme which will be trialled in England and Wales in January 2018.</p>
<p>To avoid any accusations of sexual misconduct, every male in the country will first have to go through a five stage process involving five different governmental departments before approaching any woman in speech or further congress.</p>
<p>Mrs. May outlined the process in brief which from beginning to end would take eight months of bureaucracy for each case.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our politically correct Sovietized feminist agenda involves a rigorous process of questioning each male&#8217;s intention before he even addresses any female. Furthermore, if the male admits that he wants to sleep with the female in the future, he will be taken back to the first agency in the chain and rigorously vetted and questioned there for months, before beginning the whole process again. Our role is to only engender congress between men and women in a non sexual way. Beautiful women have been looked upon as sexual objects for too long, and our agency will put a stop to any thoughts of hanky panky,&#8221; district director, Leslie Lesbo, told the Guardian newspaper.</p>
<p><strong>Here is a list of the five agencies men will have to go through before even thinking of chatting to a woman or asking her out on a date:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Primary Female Protection Service Unit One Ministry of Political Correctness Soviet Branch</li>
<li>Secondary Male Interrogational Facility Killallmen Judicial Branch</li>
<li>Third Emasculation Unit Programming Section Ballbreaker Femistasi Branch</li>
<li>Fourth Homosexuality Training Area For Destabilizing Hetero-Masculinity Branch</li>
<li>Fifth Castration Unit For All Males De-Testosteronizing Branch</li>
</ol>
<p>Only after going through all five units, will any male, on each female case, be allowed to even begin speaking to a woman.</p>
<p>So, what happens if a man propositions a woman without going through the five stage, eight month process?</p>
<p>&#8220;By addressing a female with a male tone of voice, you are impinging on her rights as a female to not be accosted sexually by a male. Even looking at a woman will bring about criminal harassment proceedings against any male. As for passionately grabbing a woman, looking her in the eyes longingly and voraciously kissing her on her pouting red lips, that is an immediate sexual harassment offence leading to thirty years in a prison or a Twitter re-education camp,&#8221; Kommandant Mildred Matron, chief officer of unit 5 Castration For All Males De-Testosteronizing Branch added.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;I have to say, very honestly, as much as I hate and detest anything British, when it comes to your peas, there is nothing like that. They are so green, succulent, and they smell so fresh especially just after they pop out of the pod. I love the way they roll around the plate, maybe if I am having a cod nicely battered and some chips, you know frites, but in the Britain they cut the potato thicker, and I even tried mushy peas once, oh they were exquisite a true culinary delight,&#8221; Mr Verhofstadt said.</p>
<p>When asked at a recent EU conference about the response to Brexit Mr. Verhofstadt added:</p>
<p>&#8220;I sometimes get peas delivered from the British Isles to my château on the outskirts of Brussels. Frozen peas, yes, frozen, I like to pull down my underpants on a hot day then put a bag of frozen peas over my man peas in their pod. Yes, if the temperature is hot on a sunny day frozen peas always do the trick in cooling you down. Sensational feeling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pea soup! The lovely gentle creamy taste of peas in a broth on a cold winter&#8217;s day. Sometimes I venture into my dungeon and feed the captives I hold there. I give them a little pea soup before I get my torture tools out. Oops, did I give it away. No, it is a joke, I am not a psychopath. I love peas, the more the better, even as a dessert you can have a few raw peas on your flambé, or an omelette mushrooms, peas and cheese.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was telling Jean Claude, I said to him, in the morning when you wake up, instead of a cognac glass try a plate of peas, maybe soaked in cognac. He tried it the next day and told me that it really hit the spot. What&#8217;s more, when he met Merkel a few hours later, he told me he burped and a little pea flew out of his mouth and landed on her cleavage. Oh la la where could he look? She took the pea, put it in her mouth and savoured the exquisite and superior pea taste.</p>
<p>&#8220;Peas are better than Brussels sprouts though. Okay I am a strong European but there is no way a sprout can beat a pea. No, (finka flanka fphlemm peas flug fliga flonk) <em>unintintelligible Flemish</em>&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We hired DaQuan Jonquil Teneel Esq. III, you know to do some filing, but all he does is kneel on the floor now. It&#8217;s hard because I asked him to move some files across the room to our copy administration person and it took him half an hour to go four metres, by that time we had lost an important client, now we just email the documents,&#8221; an exasperated boss at Google&#8217;s Mountain View campus revealed.</p>
<p>Jacquinda Quanell Jackson, a secretary for a top law firm in New York City, is also under the microscope as she kneels now on a constant basis, even delivering coffee to her bosses whilst on one knee.</p>
<p>&#8220;I aksed her, I said, Jacquinda, I been working six hours straight on this case, can you get me the Masterson papers and a cup of coffee. Took her another four hours to bring the things I wanted to the office on one knee. By that time I was ready to put some lead into anything that moved,&#8221; an angry attorney at Licksbittle Thompson Speares Litigation added.</p>
<p>Shamon Labronce Ebolaishaun, an English teacher for Gaitesberg High School in Massachusetts, kneels constantly in and out of class. The headteacher for the school does not know how to deal with the situation, as many of the kids are baffled as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shamon is kneeling from 7 am in the morning in the staff meeting till 4 pm in the afternoon. He even kneels whilst conducting English lessons to the pupils much to our dismay about his behaviour, there is nothing we can do to rectify the situation as to fire him would see us condemned for racism,&#8221; the distraught headmaster revealed.</p>
<p>Waquisha Simone Laptoyanqua, a nurse at a Los Angeles hospital has been kneeling for weeks now and many patients&#8217; lives have been put in danger. Her bosses are at their wits end at what do about her?</p>
<p>&#8220;One of our patients was having a cardiac arrest, we asked Waquisha to get the defibrillator to save the man&#8217;s life. It would have taken her at least an hour to shuffle whilst kneeling to the emergency equipment cupboard, so the doctor bypassed her, rushed to the cupboard, retrieved the defibrillator and rushed to save the man&#8217;s life. If was not for his quick thinking, the patient would have died,&#8221; a furious hospital administrator added.</p>
<p>Raymond Wantinka Johnsons, a shoeshiner from New York City constantly kneels for his clients when he&#8217;s spit shining shoes on the corner of 5th Avenue. He is the only one who can get away with a kneeling protest, because he kneels all the time any way.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am protesting and spit shining at the same time. I can make mirrors outta shoes. At the same time I&#8217;m kneeling in protest. The good thing is I make $80 a day and they don&#8217;t even know I&#8217;m protesting,&#8221; Raymond quips before setting upon a new customer.</p>

<p>Why not watch the game of rugby instead? In fact, the game of rugby is what American football is derived from, one of the only differences in the game is that rugby players do not wear steel helmets or body armour.</p>
<p>It is claimed that a pupil of Rugby school, William Webb Ellis, invented the game of rugby in 1823, however this is disputed by some.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football">American football</a> adopted many of the features of the game of rugby including the goal posts, the shape of the ball, and the scoring system where the ball crosses the goal post line and is touched down.</p>

<p>Dear Ex-NFL fans,</p>
<p>It is truly disgraceful that highly-paid members of your teams as well as NFL management have sided with a ridiculous protest, when the field should be about the game and nothing else. To disrespect the American national anthem when so many have died so that people can live under a free democracy is the biggest kick in the teeth, especially for veterans and those serving in the military today. U.S. soldiers put their lives at risk every day, not for some over-paid ungrateful idiot who cannot string a coherent sentence together, to get down on their knee and disrespect you the fans, America and all who gave their lives for the country.</p>
<p>This is why you should watch Rugby Union right now. They do not show disrespect when the anthem is played, and would welcome you to the sport with open arms.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget, rugby is where American football came from, so why not go back to the real roots of the game. We welcome you with open arms.</p>
<p>Rugby is a game played by real men with no body pads, body armour, shoulder pads or steel helmets and no ridiculous socialist protests. Real injuries, real skill, real spirit &#8212; a real game.</p>

<p>All the Social Justice Warriors, radical feminazis, trans social spreaders, anti-free speech, LGBTNXDSYs, Black Lives Matter, Antifa terrorists etc have all become even more enraged due to not only losing front of stage under the Obama supremacy but the new president Trump coming into ascendancy.</p>
<p>Socialists, Marxists, Communists are actually more dangerous when they&#8217;re on the backfoot, because they have more to fight for, and become even more triggered than usual.</p>
<p>&#8220;These people are brainwashed Marxist indoctrinated pawns of guys like Soros and Obama.</p>
<p>&#8220;Their role is simply to divide communities, create a climate of hatred, and turn families against each other.</p>
<p>&#8220;The funny thing is once they complete their jobs, they will be discarded like used tissues by their masters,&#8221; an informed person revealed about the plan.</p>
<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x-1xB8zQe9g" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The brutal truth is that even though the U.S. is meant to be led by a Republican president, Donald Trump has been wholly ineffectual in pretty much every effort he has made to move America towards a more patriotic family orientated stance. This is because of the guerilla warfare tactics being used by the extreme leftists who are funded by various sovietized groups and rich individuals.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will take many years of de-programming of America&#8217;s youth, who are now entrenched in their <a href="https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/26144-students-cry-pain-safe-spaces-invaded-campus.html">Safe Spaces</a> and <a href="https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/18240-micro-aggressions-killing-students.html">Microaggression</a> politically correct socialist world and are mollycoddled every step of the way by their educators (Marxist indoctrinators).</p>
<p>&#8220;Either, people pipe down, or within a year or so we will have civil war. Let me guess who will win any type of war?</p>
<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3trmWWBUjN0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it won&#8217;t be the feminist SJW transgender BLM gay safe spacers for sure, because they can&#8217;t shoot a gun.</p>
<p>&#8220;They were trained by Obamamites to hate guns, so they would be defenceless easy targets for the heavily trained and armed conservative Americans.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be like a turkey shoot, or shooting fish in a barrel,&#8221; a militia man from Wisconsin added.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it&#8217;s not just the college kids who have been indoctrinated in communist theory and ideals, under the eight long years of Obama rule, the major tech companies were under his spell, and these large internet all-controlling conglomerates are fighting against free speech as well. If the message is Marxist or socialist it is allowed, however any other opinion is censored and relegated to the bottom of the search results or removed completely.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>Google, a company that spends billions of dollars on research and development, still hasn’t found a good reason for everyone to own a pair of smart glasses. But an international team of researchers is rethinking how upgraded glasses could be useful—by turning the wearer’s nose bogies into a discreet power source.</p>
<p>Computer scientists from SHAISTER University in South Korea, the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, the Georgia Institute of Technology in the United States, and Fukuoku University in Japan, took a unique approach to the smart glasses they designed. As detailed in a new paper, ItchyNoseBogey: Discreet Power Integration using proprietary energy cell technology in Smart Eyewear, being presented today at the International Symposium on Wearable Computers, instead of trying to carry around a massive battery pack they simply added a series of electrooculographic energy transducer lithium impulse generators to the bridge and nose pads of the glasses.</p>
<p>These energy transducer cells are designed to measure electrical signals in and around the nose, and have been used for powering the Smart glasses from the bogeys of a user.</p>
<p>Chief project engineer, Lee Yon Fuk, revealed that the &#8220;bigger the bogey, the longer you can charge the Smart Glasses&#8221; and that &#8220;sneezing your nose into a special electroconducting cellular energy transducing tissue&#8221; gives the device a much needed power surge.</p>
<p>The smart glasses, which look no different than a regular pair of specs, are apparently able to discern between the wearer flicks, holding, or rubbing their bogeys with a finger, and those subtle movements can be translated into further electrical energy creation within the microbattery transducer charging system within the device.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26314" src="https://cdn-media.httpid.com/c202/2017/09/pick-nose.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://cdn-media.httpid.com/c202/2017/09/pick-nose.jpg 600w, https://cdn-media.httpid.com/c202/2017/09/pick-nose-300x225.jpg 300w, https://cdn-media.httpid.com/c202/2017/09/pick-nose-80x60.jpg 80w, https://cdn-media.httpid.com/c202/2017/09/pick-nose-265x198.jpg 265w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>So imagine you’re sitting in a meeting and have to look like you’re paying rapt attention to your boss’ every word, but you’d rather be digging deep in your nasal cavity for that elusive, scratchy bogey. A simple finger in your nose, which wouldn’t look out of place, could let you jumpstart your device if it&#8217;s low on charge. The glasses love bogeys of all shapes and sizes, long greenies, sloppy sneezies or those hard edged bogies that you have to really dig for.</p>
<p>The key aspect of these smart glasses is that you could be stuck in a desert where there are no usb power points, or you could be on a desert island where there is no electricity. Just dig into your nostrils, and pick out a nice juicy bogey, feed it into the integral power inducing system et voila, you now have enough power for a week.</p>
<p>This incredible technology will be available next year, and already Barbara Streisand has ordered five pairs of Smart glasses from the tech team. How&#8217;s that for marketing?</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>The brutal dictator&#8217;s briefs, which have a &#8216;surprisingly large&#8217; 39-inch waist and are initialled &#8216;A.H.&#8217;, were left behind in a suite at the luxury Parkhotel Graz in Austria after he stayed there in December 1941.</p>
<p>The Führer had been staying in the hotel when he heard the news of Germany&#8217;s defeat at the hands of the Russians during the ill-fated Operation Barbarossa invasion of Russia.</p>
<p>Auctioneer Ronnie Papadapadapapoulos said he believed the underwear was sent to the hotel&#8217;s laundry department but were rejected and were only returned after Hitler and his entourage had checked out in a hurry.</p>
<p>The seller was the grandson of the hotel&#8217;s owners at the time.</p>
<p>Ronnie, who owns Bilko&#8217;s Historical Auctions in Takoma Park, Maryland, where the 19-inch long white linen shorts sold for $6,737 (£4,991) to a private buyer, said they were in &#8216;pristine shit stained&#8217; condition.</p>
<p>He added: &#8220;People were flocking to this Adolf Hitler underwear like bluebottles to a freshly laid steamy doggy turd.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a very rare item, I mean it&#8217;s gotta Hitler shit stain directly down the back. People can actually smell it even after all those years.</p>
<p>&#8220;They were retained in the family who owned the hotel, which is very prestigious, for almost 80 years, and when we got them they were wrapped in tissue paper in a box. The smell is still slightly there but over time it has faded. Nevertheless, it shows that Hitler was just a human, he shit his pants when the Russians pushed the Jerries out of Russia.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a fascinating thing. It&#8217;s as close as you can get to Adolf Hitler, literally.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ronnie, 58, who ruled out selling the shorts to any member of the political far right before the auction, added: &#8220;I imagine the buyer would probably frame the shorts. It would be the most talked about relic in the house.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hitler stayed in the hotel a week before Germany was pushed out of Russia with a terrible defeat for the German army and Ronnie believes Hitler was touring the country ahead of returning to his retreat in the Bavarian mountains to lick his wounds.</p>
<p>The item&#8217;s description read: &#8220;A monogrammed pair of Adolf Hitler&#8217;s striped white linen under shorts with a 12.5 inch skid mark in the back. The shorts are surprisingly large &#8211; 19-inches long, with a waist of about 39 inches.&#8221;</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>Poor old Theresa May, she hasn&#8217;t been having a good time of it lately. Scammed by the EU to extend Brexit by an extra two years so that the EU can charge Britain through the teeth, then add on an extra leaving bill on after that &#8212; May has committed the UK to financial slavery to the EU for many years to come.</p>
<p>According to Theresa May&#8217;s senior aides, the PM is so gullible that she actually replied to a Nigerian email scam asking her to deposit $4.5 billion in an account in Lagos. Theresa May was so taken by the email in her inbox, that she bypassed key Treasury clearance protocols and okayed the funds herself, much to the chagrin of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s so naive, and gullible that we have to keep an eye on her at all times,&#8221; another Number 10 staff member told the Telegraph.</p>
<p>The letter that Theresa May received was the classic Nigerian scam, and after much wrangling we were able to get some excerpts:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE-STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">I am Dr. Bakundo Elotunde, the second cousin once removed of Nigerian Astronaut, Air Force Major Mnongo Elotunde. He was the first African in space when he made a secret flight to the Salyut 5 space station in 1978. He was on a later Soviet spaceflight, Soyuz T-15Z to the secret Soviet military space station Salyut 8T in 1989. He was stranded there in 1990 when the Soviet Union was dissolved. His other Soviet crew members returned to earth on the Soyuz T-15Z, but his place was taken up by return cargo. There have been occasional Progrez supply flights to keep him going since that time. He is in good humour, but wants to come home.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">In the 27-years since he has been on the station, he has accumulated flight pay and interest amounting to almost $ 15 billion American Dollars. This is held in a trust at the Lagos National Savings and Trust Association. If we can obtain access to this money, we can place a down payment with the Russian Space Authorities for a Soyuz return flight to bring him back to Earth. I am told this will cost $ 4.5 billion American Dollars. In order to access the his trust fund we need your assistance.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Consequently, my colleagues and I are willing to transfer the total amount to your account or subsequent disbursement, since we as civil servants are prohibited by the Code of Conduct Bureau (Civil Service Laws) from opening and/ or operating foreign accounts in our names.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Needless to say, the trust reposed on you at this juncture is enormous. In return, we have agreed to offer you 20 percent of the transferred sum, while 10 percent shall be set aside for incidental expenses (internal and external) between the parties in the course of the transaction. You will be mandated to remit the balance 70 percent to other accounts in due course.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the gullible PM was thwarted from sending any funds to Nigeria on Friday, when senior Treasury staff were alerted to the PM&#8217;s actions and stepped in to stop the money transfer at the last moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Luckily we saved not only the PM&#8217;s blushes, but the taxpayer from falling foul from this terrible scam. We would like to alert anyone else who thinks about replying to any such email not to do so. Only the dumbest, most naive gullible idiot would fall for such a see-through scam, isn&#8217;t that right Mrs May?&#8221; the Foreign Secretary quipped during a press meeting on Monday.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our new image now is a big tube of lube, that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re now called Luber,&#8221; Chief marketing strategist in charge of the project, Slippy Slider told the Evening Standard.</p>
<p>The multi-million pound rebranding operation took two minutes to conceive thanks to the help of advertising agency Kitch Flannel Joelkins who won the contract after a massive bidding war between rival agencies.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was at my Madam&#8217;s house, who I visit every Tuesday. I had just been given the Uber rebranding contract and just as I was slipping into my latex suit I stepped on a large tube of Lube and hit my head on the Madam&#8217;s boot. Picking up the tube of lube, I immediately made the connection UBER &#8211; LUBER,&#8221; creative consultant, Miles Abergumber revealed.</p>
<p>Well, now that there will not be any Uber cabs in London, former clients can rest assured that the Uber board of directors will be using plenty of Luber lube. Let us congratulate Luber on its new business direction.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p><span class="dropcap" style="background-color: #333333;">M</span>el Brooks, a giant, a monster of comedic timing and innuendo has chimed in on the current <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/09/21/stupidly-politically-correct-society-death-comedy-warns-veteran/">political correct</a> censorship malaise infecting the climate of comedic discourse these days.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not good for comedy. Comedy has to walk a thin line, take risks,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Comedy is the lecherous little elf whispering in the king&#8217;s ear, always telling the truth about human behaviour.&#8221;</p>
<p>Offending anyone is now pretty much forbidden, jokes are not allowed that relate to anything that is about human society or culture, the newspapers are filled with <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/sex-joke-ruined-ending-kingsman-secret-service/">socialist snowflake censors</a> masquerading as &#8216;journalists&#8217; when they would not look out of place in the Ministry of Truth in George Orwell&#8217;s 1984 or some deranged feminazi re-education facility in Soviet Russia.</p>
<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yTAejTT3Iyg" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The media establishments from the right to the left are now censorship driven indoctrinated propaganda machines that constantly drive the politically correct message to their brainwashed audience. If for one second there is any dissent or an opposing opinion in the comments section, it is immediately deleted. There is now very little distinction between any mainstream media organization with regards to the PC agenda.</p>
<p>The level of indoctrination of course comes firstly from the education system, where the latest generation are now called &#8216;snowflakes&#8217; alluding to their propensity to be constantly offended by everything.</p>
<p><center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zdCjbJ6NEfc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Melt You</strong></p>
<p>To live a life as a &#8216;snowflake generation&#8217; member must be truly intolerable, it is a state of perpetual distress, constant SJW marching with ridiculous signs aloft, and the threat of ones &#8216;<a href="https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/26144-students-cry-pain-safe-spaces-invaded-campus.html">safe space</a>&#8216; being invaded so horribly that suicide probably crosses their intolerant blinkered <a href="https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/18240-micro-aggressions-killing-students.html">micro-aggression</a> frazzled minds on a constant basis. These are people who are supposed to be progressives but cannot progress above any thought apart from following other &#8216;snowflakes&#8217; like lemmings onto the next useless dehumanising cause. Just fucking kill yourselves already, at least this will free up some carbon emissions on the planet.</p>
<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l-2h4XnKZ3g" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks to these sovietized brainwashed jerks, comedy and humour is now something you find from watching past comedians and shows. The sad part is that it will get worse, and worse, like some sort of sharia ISIS wet dream, the last of the comedian warriors will be strung up, whipped and dragged through the streets in front of jeering politically correct crowds dressed all in grey suits.</p>
<p>Is there a flicker of light at the end of this dystopian humourless socialist nightmare we are all now forced to live in? Everything is now <a href="https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/opinion/25698-end-free-speech-daily-squib-censored-google.html">censored</a> to death, to laugh is now a crime, freedom of expression is a pipe dream that can only be realised by shutting up shop and living a life of silence.</p>
<p>Yes, one can achieve true freedom of speech.</p>
<p>Here is how:</p>
<ol>
<li>Only write on a typewriter, paper, or a computer not connected to the internet.</li>
<li>Never publish your words. Don&#8217;t worry about this one, because no one in the current PC malaise will publish you any way.</li>
<li>Read your words yourself and chuckle to yourself. Never show another soul what you wrote.</li>
</ol>

<p>Hollywood has been left floundering as their sales drift in the wind.</p>
<p>Disney streaming on the internet will certainly fill a niche market, however the whole Disney repertoire is available to stream for free right now on the internet. The same goes for any series, film or documentary you have ever heard of.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all out there to be watched and streamed for free, from the putlocker, to the 123movies to whatever name they&#8217;re calling themselves after being shut down on one server, and moving to another. The servers are most probably in China somewhere, and cannot be shut down as no such thing as copyright exists in the Chinese mindset or law.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks to the free movie streaming sites. I&#8217;ve watched pretty much every film there is in history and frankly I&#8217;m bored now. I watch films now a few weeks before they&#8217;re released in the UK. Like the other day I was walking in the street and saw a bus with a sign for a film that I saw three weeks ago streamed online for free in full HD quality. So, the reasoning here is, why should I pay ten quid to get a ticket and another eight for some popcorn and a drink? Exactly!&#8221; some guy said from outside an empty cinema somewhere in London.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a mystery how Hollywood funds its films these days or brings in new talent, especially with millions of people on the streaming sites watching away for free.</p>
<p>Film executive, Elmer Johnson, told the LA Times: &#8220;We just make safe bet films these days with the same old stars. That&#8217;s the only way to break even. Superhero movies, remakes of remakes of remakes, some rom coms for the ladies, and cutesy animated movies, ya know, talking penguins and sausages. If we make a movie without major realistic looking high end expensive shit CGI action it&#8217;s a flopper. Remember that kids these days have an attention span of about 3.5 seconds. If something big does not happen quick, they switch off so we have to make massive explosions, car crashes and more explosions. Fight scenes, heck we have to make them so fast that you don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s happening, not like real life where ya get the guy swinging that long arm you can see from space, we&#8217;re talking nanosecond Jason Bourne fights. Also, let me add, dark movies, movies filmed with minimal light so the viewer does not know what&#8217;s happening and all of this with murmured dialogue no one can understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>Key in any film title and watch for free right now on the internet.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>If there ever was a person who needed a bit of zen Buddhism, Sinead needs a big fucking dose now.</p>
<p>The eternal misappropriated child, O&#8217;Connor is always crying out for attention, and always wanting to be loved, in a world unforgiving as it is today, to make rambling videos only deepens the malaise as it brings in others who at the end of the day are no good for this constantly craving woman.</p>
<p>The music biz, an unforgiving trench of faeces spits out artists through its continually turning meat grinder. If you show any sign of doubt, you are sucked under, a music casualty forever maligned, a shadow of a shadow, one of Satan&#8217;s rejects. If you however reach up and take the bull by the horns, then you may have some longevity.</p>
<p>After all, what is Sinead O&#8217;Connor apart from someone who sang a Prince song sometime in the 90&#8217;s?</p>
<p>Call it the drugs, the mental illness, the sad childhood, there&#8217;s always a blame culture embedded in the perpetual victim, and it is a vicious cycle rearing its ugly head every time the hormonal cycle turns. Sinead blames everyone and everything else apart from herself.</p>
<p>Ripping up a picture of the Pope, was possibly the most endearing thing Sinead did, however there are a lot of brainwashed Catholics out there, and record sales did suffer after that escapade. Yes, the Catholic church is a safe place for paedophiles and other assorted monsters to conduct their evil practices without fear of reprisal, but it is also a heavily fortified institution that is followed by millions of mindless people who cannot think for themselves or formulate their own thoughts, and these morons do buy records as well.</p>
<p><center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2dKdBlKgquw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center></p>
<p>Sinead says that she only delves in the truth and honesty, however in the music biz, this can be a serious flag, and any executive will tell their artists to shut up or watch their sales plummet.</p>
<p>So, what hope is there for Sinead, &#8216;stuck in the arse end of New Jersey&#8217;? Sure, she is stuck in a motel with some seriously dodgy decor, but it does look clean enough. This is the end of an artist who certainly did not play by the rules in the music biz, and many in a record company will cite her as an example of someone who just did not get it. You play the game, you listen, you get on, sell your soul, and you will get the reward if you are lucky enough, otherwise you end up like Sinead O&#8217;Connor, a sad lump of meat that&#8217;s been through the grinder, maybe three or four times.</p>
<p>Should there be any pity for such a creature? Certainly not, for to give pity to self-pity only equals a disgusting soup of sickly mewling detritus. With someone who has had all the opportunities as O&#8217;Connor and her propensity to throw it all away every single time, there should not be an ounce of pity, but only disgust.</p>
<p>When an artist gets to the abyss, they have two choices, either jump across or fall in.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>There was a time when even the mention of ISIS would bring up the fear in people, however in the last two years we have seen a massive decline in their influence as well as strategic hold in Iraq and Syria.</p>
<p>One could postulate that ISIS, is more than just an organisation but an ideology, and some part of this thesis could be true, however if the land is not held by their soldiers, then they lose strategic value and compromise their ideology from spreading.</p>
<p>Despite the regular servings of gruesome execution videos to social media and the internet, and some irregular attacks on Western cities, ISIS has been floundering for some time.</p>
<p>The reason for this loss of territory, is of course the age old configuration. Without any air force, or control of the air, no military unit can ever survive long term in today&#8217;s technological age.</p>
<p>Not only has ISIS been beaten down with US, and other Allied air supremacy but by Russian and Syrian air strikes. There is no army that can ever survive such an onslaught with capitulating territory and receiving massive losses of infrastructure and men.</p>
<p>The loss of Mosul, and other major towns and cities in Iraq, as well as in Syria show that air supremacy is king. Without the jets, the military infrastructure to house and maintain the air forces, satellites, pilot training, vast spending on research and development, a military force is nothing but a sitting duck.</p>
<p>Therefore, unless ISIS somehow gain these attributes, they will eventually disappear and be pushed back further into the caves and tunnels of some mountain region.</p>

I have a very special surprise for the Teflon Don, Nick Nack will greet him when he lands on the beach, and the deadly duel will start from there, of course only after a brief civilised luncheon,&#8221; the fired communications director, Scaramanga revealed on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Apart from being a deadly shot, Scaramanga also has a distinctive extra appendage to wow the ladies with.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I have three nipples, it is a sign of greatness, and I also pride myself in being a paranoid schizophrenic.&#8221;</p>
<p>The President, who was instrumental in the firing of Scaramanga says he has accepted the invitation to the secluded island only on the proviso that he gets to take Goodnight with him back to the White House as his new plaything. Shush, don&#8217;t tell Melania.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>The lack of skilled workers in America is causing a serious problem amongst employers as many are too <a href="https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/07/24/business/economy/drug-test-labor-hiring.html?">drugged up</a> on opioids to even get out of bed, let alone conduct a full day&#8217;s work.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had some guy come in for the drug test, he was so doped up he could barely open his eyelids, then when it came to the urine test he took out a prosthetic penis from his pocket and threw it in the glass jar. The dude just didn&#8217;t care one iota,&#8221; general manager for a tire manufacturing company in Wisconsin told his local newspaper.</p>
<p>The drug of choice is a cheap opioid called Fentanyl, one hundred times more potent than morphine, imported from Chinese drug factories working 24/7 shifts to ship to the good ol&#8217; US of A.</p>
<p>Another employer for a garden tools company in Minnesota would come into work some days and find his employees floating in the ceiling area.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d have to get one of our rakes to get these fellas down. Some were so far gone that a pitchfork in the rear barely got a reaction.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many economists blame the drug craze on the loss of manufacturing jobs outsourced to Chinese factories, and if this is the case, it means that not only is China raking in huge profits from manufacturing sub-standard cheap goods for the U.S. market, but they&#8217;re actually poisoning the American work force with cheap opioid drugs.</p>

<p>The former president, Barack Obama, also legalised marijuana use in many states, and it is well documented that smoking weed slows people down.</p>
<p>&#8220;I smoke two joints for breakfast, then move onto the couch. That&#8217;s when I start rollin&#8217; all day long,&#8221; another unemployed man told newspapers.</p>
<p>Federal Reserve Chair, Janet Yellen has proposed a cure for the drugged up American population.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to counteract opioid drugs with picker uppers. Like say for example I took two pills of Fentanyl, well I need to counteract that with some crack cocaine, a smidgeon of pcp, some meth, four lines of coke, and glass of cold water poured over my face. Then I&#8217;ll be workin&#8217; like a motherfucker. We need speed, speedie Gonzalez, have those racks of hub caps polished in under a minute, stack those garden tools in thirty seconds, you know what I mean, sniff?&#8221;</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;My main issue with Dunkirk is that it’s so clearly designed for men to man-out over,&#8221; Mehantara Boner, who writes in some woman&#8217;s magazine whines, adding, &#8220;The packaging of the film, the general vibe, and the tenor of the people applauding it just screams &#8220;men-only&#8221;.</p>
<p>In her staunch feminist article, Boner has called for all World War II films to import women fighting in the front lines to show equality.</p>
<p>Although this would not be historically accurate, the writer says that having &#8220;female platoons in Iwo Jima, Guadalcanal and Dunkirk, would make the films more accessible to women, instead of just showing men fighting and being male-like&#8221;.</p>
<p>Even though millions of men sacrificed their lives in both world wars, this is not enough for modern feminists who become triggered by images of men fighting on boats and beaches.</p>
<p>&#8220;Like look at Saving Private Ryan. Spielberg should have put Scarlett Johannsen somersaulting out of the landing craft on D-Day, dodging bullets whilst shooting thousands of Germans in their parapets, then helping male soldiers with their wounds simultaneously laying down suppressing fire all the while applying another pristine lacquer polish to her nails as she brings out the bangalores.&#8221;</p>
<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sj9esSu0lg0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Dunkirk felt like an excuse for men to celebrate maleness—which apparently they don’t get to do enough. Fine, great, go forth, but if Nolan’s entire purpose is breaking the established war movie mold and doing something different—why not make a movie about women in World War II?” Boner continues whining.</p>
<p>&#8220;What about the Pacific, in the jungles, they were all male soldiers fighting and in the films, that is all you see. Why could the directors not put in female role models onto the battle scenes with the Japs? Again, we could see Wonder Woman characters jumping into battle as bullets cut down the men. The females would of course be immune to bullets and karate kick their way through whole Japanese platoons with not so much of a sweat.&#8221;</p>
<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LJeA4fpXwM0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For feminists, the hatred of men is so great that they cannot even stand the thought of seeing the sight of male sacrifice on the battlefield.</p>
<p>This is what men have done for centuries, yet the modern feminist is disgusted by this, they do not understand that if it were not for these brave young men fighting and sacrificing themselves on the beaches and in the jungles for the Allies these women would probably not have the freedom to write their claptrap anti-male clickbait nonsense today.</p>
<p>It would be a beautiful and just day to see how these feminists would cope in such a hostile battlefield, on Omaha beach, on Peleliu island, as the bullets whiz around them, and the bombs rip bodies apart. To see your buddies legs blown off in front of you, the blood soaked sand, slipping on entrails and blown out brains. It is most certain they would not last three seconds in a real battlefield scenario.</p>

<p>&#8220;We fired him for gross misconduct. We found him wandering the halls of the main HQ building only in his underpants with a woman&#8217;s bra over his head talking about the &#8216;Jibbly Jabbly Doo&#8217;s&#8217;. He then ran into the cafeteria and forcibly took one of our dinner ladies, Irene, 74, by the hand and started dancing with her on top of the counter. After that traumatic scene, Mr Mackenzie, still talking gibberish, did not realise his scrotum was dangling below his underpants entered the boardroom where executives were hashing out an important deal with Chinese investors. The Chinese investors who were attending the meeting were not at all happy when Mackenzie picked up two pens pretending they were chopsticks, and with squinty eyes started talking about &#8216;Fu Manchu&#8217; and ordering a &#8216;numbah 42&#8217; as well as a &#8216;special flied lice&#8217;,&#8221; Chairman Steve Burrows told the Financial Times.</p>
<p>Shares in AA fell by 37.7 per cent to a record low of 132p following the news. The precipitous fall of AA shares looks like a cliff face, and today it just kept on dropping and dropping.</p>

<p>&#8220;We boated out to Cancun, Mexico and dropped loads of chum in the water to attract some Great Whites. In about five minutes, we had a 26 foot long Great White shark swimming around the boat,&#8221; series producer, Mikey Voss, told the NY Post.</p>
<p>What was meant to be a 100 metre race with a genuine Great White shark then turned to disaster.</p>
<p>&#8220;Michael Phelps got on the start line and the shark was approximately three metres behind, so Phelps actually got a head start. He dived in the water and started swimming. At first, the Great White shark did nothing, then when Phelps was half way through the race, it kicked in and drew up behind him,&#8221; Voss added.</p>
<p>As the Shark Week organisers and experts desperately tried to make the shark veer to the left of Phelps instead of following him, disaster struck.</p>
<p>&#8220;Phelps was dragged under the water and we heard a blood curdling scream. You actually heard the crunching sound as the Great White bit down. We filmed everything, even the part when the shark&#8217;s eyes glaze over as it attacks,&#8221; cameraman, John Weiss, revealed.</p>
<p>The Shark Week episode will be aired in September, however some parts will be excluded due to the nature of the content.</p>
<p>Michael Phelps, who lost both legs above the knee in the attack, is still recovering. He says that he will resume his swimming career and compete in the Paralympics.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just happy, Shark Week fans eventually got the footage they wanted,&#8221; Phelps said from his hospital bed.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>According to reports from the USA, if you get severely ill and are hospitalised, you have to pay for the treatment.</p>
<p>For long recurring medical conditions, this can mean whole families can have their lives ruined financially ending up in the loss of their homes, as well as their lives.</p>
<p><strong>HOW HEALTHCARE WORKS IN AMERICA</strong></p>
<p>a) To afford to pay for healthcare private insurance, you have to have a high paying job to pay the large monthly costs and premiums.</p>
<p>b) If you do not have healthcare insurance and get sick, you are shit out of luck from receiving premium treatment and are usually referred to low tier medicare which has a very long waiting list. However, you can turn up at a proper hospital and demand treatment, the hospital will usually treat you then give you a large bill at the end of your visit, bankrupting you.</p>
<p>c) A normal treatment at a hospital which would cost you nothing in the UK, will cost Americans over $64,000. For protracted treatment, it can go up to the millions.</p>
<p>d) Most health insurance in America does not pay for certain illnesses, so unless you take the time to read the small print (which insurers can change at any time) then you will have to pay the full cost of treatment regardless of the fact that you pay full whack for insurance.</p>
<p>e) Don&#8217;t forget the fact that when you have health insurance and receive treatment you have to also pay an extra cost as a deductible. This sum can be quite large depending on the treatment cost and the insurers whim.</p>
<p>f) Apart from the threat of losing your home if you get sick in America, there&#8217;s the additional threat of losing your healthcare if you lose your job. The amount of stress this causes most Americans actually makes them sick, which is in the long run good for the medical and health insurance business.</p>
<p>g) According to the United States Census Bureau, in 2012 there were 48.0 million people in the US (15.4% of the population) who were without health insurance.</p>
<p>h) Some Americans deliberately commit crimes so they can go to prison and receive free healthcare.</p>
<p>i) If you are from outside the US, and travelling in the country you must make sure you have the correct travel insurance. If not, and you get sick, you will be stuck in the USA indefinitely until you pay off your vast hospital bills.</p>
<p>j) None of the above relates to the NHS in the UK as all treatment is free.</p>

<p>Prince Harry, not the brainiest chap in the world wants to tell everyone about his mental issues, especially regarding the death of his mama, and then comes Prince William later on saying a few words here or there about his issues, however what may have been an innocent looking confession will now come back as a large bite.</p>
<p>Already the gutter press are getting ready to post those &#8216;lost&#8217; Diana tapes where she speaks to her voice coach. The people posting the videos are citing Harry and William&#8217;s need to talk as the reason for them dredging up this soon to be money making video. The damage to the royals will thus be another plunging knife into the monarchy and its rotting sarcophagus.</p>
<p><strong>Pont d’Alma Temple de Diana</strong></p>
<p>If Harry and Wills knew the truth, of which they must suspect, about how their mother was dispatched, they would nonetheless be not so keen to air their dirty laundry in front of everyone.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-25874 size-medium alignright" src="https://cdn-media.httpid.com/c202/2017/07/Diane_de_Versailles_Leochares-225x300.jpg" alt="Diane_de_Versailles_Leochares" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://cdn-media.httpid.com/c202/2017/07/Diane_de_Versailles_Leochares-225x300.jpg 225w, https://cdn-media.httpid.com/c202/2017/07/Diane_de_Versailles_Leochares-600x800.jpg 600w, https://cdn-media.httpid.com/c202/2017/07/Diane_de_Versailles_Leochares.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></p>
<p>We will never know why all traffic cameras were mysteriously switched off in Paris on the night of Diana&#8217;s death, and why she was kept in the tunnel where the crash occurred for over three hours whilst the hospital was less than a mile away. As for the driver, who was an MI6 asset, we will never know why he slammed the car into a pillar or any other detail research theorists have dredged up.</p>
<p>The fact that Diana was to marry a Muslim Egyptian and was pregnant with Dodi Fayed&#8217;s child will not be revealed any time soon either. How could the Windsors ever carry on with this stuff going on in front of them and blasted around the world news, where the Princes mother had mixed with Arab blood? There is no question that this state of affairs was intolerable to the royal family and something had to be done sharpish.</p>
<p>The princes thus need to learn to keep a dignified silence if they wish to keep their places. All this self indulgent nanny talk is useless and only hurts their own interests, as well as the British monarchy. Besides, they would not like the answers they found if they themselves investigated the sordid Diana ritual on that fateful rainy Parisian night.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a deep hatred for the British and Americans because they liberated France in WW2 from German occupation. We actually never asked to be liberated and still feel great resentment. This is why we are now so close to Germany, our eternal captors, who rule over us even after the end of the great war,&#8221; Barnier told Le Monde newspaper on Thursday.</p>
<p>Reminiscing about the good old days when troops of German Waffen SS marched up and down the Champs-Élysées, Barnier was only a child but he remembers those days with great affection in his heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;They would come and give us sweets, chocolate at school. Then they read out a list and some kids were taken away, I think they were Jewish, but I just thought to myself, hmmm, more chocolate for me,&#8221; Barnier recalled.</p>
<p>The German occupation of France was delightful for many French people, as the beloved Parisian architecture and boulevards were preserved from bombing, and the Nazis brought many luxury goods. The French collaborated with their captors with great ease, and this explains their endearing attitude towards Germany today. The two nations seem to be locked in some sort of sado-masochistic clinch that befuddles other allied nations.</p>
<p>Sir Winston Churchill <a href="https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/16803-what-churchill-really-thought-of-the-european-union.html">envisaged</a> a liberated Europe post war scenario where France and Britain led the new Europe, instead the French rejected Britain at every level and sided with their captors Germany. A sad detrimental partnership where the abused is gladly led by the abuser.</p>
<p>Much to the chagrin of liberators on August 25 1944, there were many French people who held a great resentment at being liberated by the American and British forces. It is a sad note that somehow explains the EU today, and how Britain, as much as it has done for France has always been shunned and denigrated.</p>

<p>&#8220;These robots are meant to adore you and only you. That&#8217;s what the salesman told me. I brought her home that night and was immediately disappointed by its behaviour. Carla took one look at me, then told me I was a fat, balding, stinky human with the intelligence level of a cow, she then walked over to the washing machine and started stroking it seductively,&#8221; Baccarat recalled.</p>
<p>Luckily, we have consumer rights so Mr. Baccarat called the store from which he purchased the robot.</p>
<p>&#8220;They didn&#8217;t want to know. They just said the AI was working fine after a diagnostic, and that robots have their own rights too. They should be allowed to choose who they get turned on by as much as humans have a choice. This is when I took the case to the courts.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Courts of Justice, recently filed a new law giving sex robots, and any other robot working in human households as many rights as humans. In fact, there are laws being introduced by next year, 2045, that sentient AI robots will be allowed to vote in elections, and even start their own businesses.</p>
<p>Things are therefore not looking up for Mr Baccarat, who has now filed for his sex robot to be scrapped, but the request was emphatically denied.</p>

<p>This is the state of the human condition in the millennial era, where so-called &#8216;<a href="https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/18240-micro-aggressions-killing-students.html">microaggressions</a>&#8216; cause the death of countless snowflakes too fragile to cope with anything in real life.</p>
<p>The spoiled brats of Western civilisation are an indication of serious decline, these little fairies have been indoctrinated in socialist Marxist political correctness for so long that they don&#8217;t have a life any more, and their pathetic social justice projects are all that define them.</p>
<p>How does someone in the Third World look upon these idiots crying over their internet messages, or irrelevant twitter arguments. These words they spout are inconsequential in the scheme of things, and will be consigned to the hard disk of eternal purgatory never to be read ever again.</p>
<p>This is the problem with giving everyone a voice, everyone a channel to express their inane thoughts, and this is why the earth is now surrounded by a mire of shit conversation, inadequate nonsense and utterly pathetic bubbling detritus.</p>
<p>Warhol once said everyone would eventually have their fifteen minutes of fame, and he was unfortunately right, we are now living in a mass market conglomerate nightmare where low-IQ American kids are exploited and elevated to super stardom on YouTube, which equates to absolutely nothing in real-fame measure, however they think they are famous in their own sad little heads. Do they realise how they are being exploited for advertising revenue for the conglomerate? Who knows what goes through their frazzled internet driven minds? Who fucking cares?</p>
<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hUFSc77VUOw" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lest we forget the irrelevance of being famous in today&#8217;s squalid meat market, where it is hard to name any single one of these people or their accomplishments. To be famous today, is to be just another person in a crowd of many, and this is why it is better not to be famous or even aspire to be amongst the sad pieces of meat that spout their dumbed down low-IQ crap at the screen day in day out. They have absolutely no merit, what have they done, what have they accomplished?</p>
<p>The only stars today worth talking about are the exploiters, the Googles, the Facebooks, the conglomerates who exploit the human cow dung and make money from it. These are the stars, because they are making tonnes of money out of idiots and performing monkeys <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/06/29/us-woman-shoots-boyfriend-dead-youtube-stunt-boost-online-profile/">willing to kill</a> themselves or each other for one second of internet fame.</p>
<p>Let the show go on, just that we don&#8217;t want to watch it any more..please&#8230;no more&#8230;Aaaargh!</p>

<p>&#8220;We were meeting the Saudi King when Donald let off a large ripping fart. We all waited for a second, then the smell wafted around. Imagine a bouquet of rotten eggs, sardines, mouldy cheese alongside curdling milk and fermenting sewage, and you get the picture. Naturally, my husband did the honourable thing and ignored it, whilst the Saudi King was seen retching and looking around wildly for an escape route.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs Trump, always the pleaser, also describes how her husband farts with such gusto in bed, that he actually stains the bed sheets, and they have to be changed every hour by White House cleaners.</p>
<p>&#8220;He eats the regular stuff. He has three or four steaks every day, lots of eggs and burritos by the dozen. We are not sure what is causing the problem as everything is organic and gluten free?&#8221; Melania Trump revealed in the interview.</p>
<p>With such a productive gut, there are concerns amongst White House aides on what could happen when the Trumps visit the Royal family in Britain in December.</p>
<p>&#8220;Royal protocol is rather strict however having a U.S President farting copiously in front of the Queen could be quite amusing and bring an air of comedy to proceedings. We are sure Her Majesty has seen and heard a lot more in her time, especially with the Duke and his legendary rippers,&#8221; palace spokesman, Giles Humble, revealed on Monday.</p>

<p>&#8220;Booboo, is an African elephant and stands at 4m height. He will stay at the ISS for three weeks before coming back down to earth. We wish to measure many things about elephants in space, and to have such a large mammal up in space, how we can relate the mission to future Mars travel. Imagine having elephants on Mars or any other planet,&#8221; professor Gene Artnick, chief engineer of the mission told Reuters.</p>
<p>To lift such a heavy load into space is something the scientists at Los Alamos have been working on for the last six years, but have finally come up with the right rocket design after many failures.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had one elephant get to the stratosphere but the rocket failed for the last push. Good thing it had a parachute, but y&#8217;all gotta see an elephant in freefall. His ears were everywhere, and the parachute was huge, like half a football field,&#8221; another engineer on the project revealed.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25639" src="https://cdn-media.httpid.com/c202/2017/07/axiom-core-attached-iss.jpg" alt="axiom-core-attached-iss" width="640" height="353" srcset="https://cdn-media.httpid.com/c202/2017/07/axiom-core-attached-iss.jpg 640w, https://cdn-media.httpid.com/c202/2017/07/axiom-core-attached-iss-300x165.jpg 300w, https://cdn-media.httpid.com/c202/2017/07/axiom-core-attached-iss-600x331.jpg 600w, https://cdn-media.httpid.com/c202/2017/07/axiom-core-attached-iss-696x385.jpg 696w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Gregor Illorski, one astronaut at the International Space Station says he can&#8217;t wait for Booboo to visit.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have special compartment built, we have straw and lots of buckets he can poo in. At zero gravity we will have some problems especially when he piss, but we have designed a bag that will go over his private part. The waste product will be used to fertilize our plants we are growing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elephants are renowned for their memory, and this will be one memory Booboo will cherish for the rest of his life when he comes back to earth.</p>

<p>&#8220;I offered them free tuition fees and they flocked to me, even though I had no way of ever paying for the false promises. I still disrupted the scum Tories. Our Momentum Marxist group then told the students they could vote twice. They obeyed the orders and nearly took the election. Cheating in elections is permissible in revolutions, especially Marxist ones.,&#8221; Jeremy Corbyn told the leftist BBC from his dacha in Grimsby.</p>
<p>During the General election of 2017, Theresa May lost the Conservatives majority in parliament and was nearly toppled from her position as PM.</p>
<p>Many students, and low information voters were totally blinded by the promises of freebies by the lying Corbyn junta during the run-up to polling day.</p>
<p>&#8220;We won the election purely on the premise we disrupted the Tory majority. So what if we cheated, what are they going to do about it? Nothing. The next election we will ask students to vote three or four times each for Labour. Cheating is okay to get into power. Stalin, once said &#8216;by any means possible&#8217; and so we shall do the same,&#8221; a Labour Momentum spokesman told the Guardian newspaper.</p>

<p>&#8220;This works both ways. The EU wants to fine us for manipulating search results. Hey its our search, we have no constraints to what we can and cannot do. Hmm, let me see here, Jean Claude Juncker on the 22nd May 2017 at 03.42 Brussels time was searching for something to do with donkeys, we will not give the full details but it involves the animal and other players. Also, during an important meeting at the Commission Juncker&#8217;s mobile address was surfing some very colourful websites that would make even Guy Verhofstadt tremble. This is just a taster. More to come. You fine us, we give you back some Google medicine,&#8221; a Google spokesman told the EU Commission on Thursday.</p>
<p>Today at an EU meeting on the implications of the fine, Mr. Juncker was visibly upset, and projectile vomited a copious amount of cognac, an entrée of foie gras poché au vin rouge épicé avec le plat du jour. Dos de cabillaud, rôti caviar de courgettes, huile vierge herbacée, and complimented with an exquisite dessert of chocolat mousse caramel, fève de tonka et feuillantine.</p>
<p>Juncker, already under pressure from Brexit and the strains of the Italian and Greek economy, does not need this extra magnifying glass insight into his private penchants.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have EU army now. Does the Google know of this? They pay, and shut up. No more threats. We are dangerous right now, even more than before in 1935. Can they not see this, instead they make me upset. Look I vomit. Allez, we have to go back to the restaurant, my stomach is grumbling again,&#8221; the president gesticulated before being rushed away through corridors and a waiting luxury car.</p>

<p>The Crown Estate made a whopping £328.8m profit last year, mainly due to those &#8216;ghastly&#8217; wind farms the royals invested in.</p>
<p>To celebrate, the Queen took to her personal hangar, and plopped herself into her favourite Supermarine Spitfire, which she lovingly calls &#8216;Smithy&#8217;.</p>
<p>Squadron Commander, Benson Molyneux, trained Her Majesty only last year and was astonished at her natural flying skills.</p>
<p>&#8220;She took to the throttle like a baby does a bottle. Before we embarked on the first flight, the Queen asked if there were any Jerries we could shoot down? With a hearty laugh, I exclaimed that we could always make a sortie to Berlin or perhaps Brussels.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Merlin</strong></p>
<p>The Queen now flies her Spitfire whenever she feels like it, and has even taken her favourite Corgi, Willow, up into the clouds on occasion.</p>
<p>&#8220;One likes the feel of the Spitfire, especially when one is conducting a half roll loop at 300mph at 15,000 feet. Yes, one has stalled a few times, that was during my third flight, one was rather careless with one&#8217;s elevators which are very sensitive and one brought up the control column too rapidly during a loop. The aeroplane shuddered and one heard this clitter clatter sound much like Philip&#8217;s hip joints, bringing the left wing suddenly downward. One managed to recover relatively quickly by cutting the throttle, applying opposite rudder to the spin, moving the stick forward gently until the spinning stopped, then gently applying one&#8217;s throttle to level the flight. One was very cool and measured at that point, but one nearly made a poopy in one&#8217;s panty.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Betrayal by Remainers</strong></p>
<p>With a Remainer Chancellor, Remainer PM, and Remainer negotiators in the mix, anyone who thought Brexit would ever happen is sadly mistaken.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/821486/Brexit-news-Theresa-May-offer-citizens-rights-criticised-Ukip-Lib-Dems">reports</a>, the Remainer PM has tabled a deal so bad with the EU that Brexit might as well only happen by name.</p>
<p>Theresa May has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/26/eu-citizens-living-in-uk-must-apply-for-special-id-card-after-brexit">extended the free movement of EU citizens</a> to five years from the EU referendum, an extension of two years. This means Britain will not be able to secure its borders by late 2020/21.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em>The Home Office said it wanted to avoid a “cliff edge” in applications the day after Brexit, and so would grant a period of up two years’ grace for EU nationals who could demonstrate five continuous years of residence in Britain.</em></p>
<p>What the new ruling would do, is create a last insurgent rush from the EU, where another million or so would enter the UK. The cut-off point should happen immediately to thwart any such rush.</p>
<p>The Daily Squib is appealing to all real Brexiteers within the Tory government to immediately conduct a rearranging of deck chairs on the sinking Brexit ship, and is calling for Rees-Mogg, Redwood, Davis and Duncan Smith to do something about this mess fast before any more damage occurs.</p>
<p>What has happened to the Conservative party today? It is sickening to watch such a lilly livered bunch of wannabe socialists actually becoming socialists. Where the fuck are your balls?</p>
<p><strong>Therexit NOW!</strong></p>
<p>There must be a coup immediately. Code Red. Theresa May is not fit for purpose, she should be sent to the glue factory to be processed.</p>
<p>GO!</p>
<p><em><strong>An apology to our readers and Theresa May. This article is wrong and is grossly misleading and hysterical in nature. Theresa May is in fact doing a great job at Brexit under the circumstances. The ex- Squib writer, Goebels Langoustine, is now working for the Evening Standard, where he belongs.</strong></em></p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>.</p>
<p><strong>Evil comes with a gentle false smiling face</strong></p>
<p>The tone of gentleness, here is a man who supposedly cares for you, who will ensure you get your benefits payments increased without question, who will allow the entirety of Sub-Saharan Africa, South East Asia and the Middle East into Britain without question.</p>
<p>This is a man who smiles at the camera, while the horrors of his evil terrorist supporting mind fester in the background. He cares about animals and does not want to see them in pain, just as he did when the <a href="https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/25201-innocent-civilians-killed-ira-jeremy-corbyn-laughed.html">IRA he supports</a> so much slaughtered six horses with nail bombs in 1982.</p>
<p>Unflinching in his dedication to surrender, here is a man who would leave Britain defenceless, and open to attack. Naturally Corbyn and his senior minions would be in the government bunker whilst up top millions of Britons die from radiation poisoning or the after effects of a nuclear strike. He would sit there with his cup of tea, and think about maybe writing a postcard or letter to our attackers telling them to stop. This stance of ineptitude and apathy in the face of defence is in fact the face of evil that Corbyn adopts as it gives him more power to do so.</p>
<p>Here is a man who will gladly flood the country with millions of more migrants so that the already stretched services will cease to function. His magic money tree, an illusion only conceived by false election promises to a dumbed down electorate who are too naive to see the reality.</p>
<p><strong>Real evil lies in irresponsibility and meticulous planning</strong></p>
<p>The inherent evil of such a man as Corbyn is hard to see but it is there, because he clouds it in the false promise of care, and hope. In reality the Labour manifesto promises are just that, promises that cannot in any way be fulfilled under the current economic climate.</p>
<p>As for UKIPers who follow the pied piper to Labour, you will see Brexit watered down to a mere shell, it will be Brexit in mere name only, and when Corbyn adopts the euro as Britain&#8217;s currency, integrating Britain into the EU in ever closer union, you will see how you were duped and fooled once more by the evil smiling bearded chap who was oh so soft spoken, surely he could not have done this, no, you will say as you cry into your pillow at night.</p>
<p>It is guaranteed Corbyn will also integrate with the SNP, thus losing any fighting chance the English have in stopping a break away referendum from happening and succeeding.</p>
<p>As the Britain we once knew turns into another socialist utopia akin to Venezuela, there will be no hope, just massive inflation, riots, huge queues for toilet paper and all services within the country will break down, irreparable, ghosts of the past, and monuments to the future under Labour.</p>
<p>Everything&#8217;s free of course under Labour&#8217;s Corbyn, but at what cost? We already have a deficit of £1.8 Trillion thanks to the previous Labour government, and so it will go on, Corbyn will add to this deficit until it reaches ten or twenty trillion pounds, why should he care, it will give him power, and this evil power has corrupted his soul into blackness. It is with this dark festering soul he will condemn Britain to a two hundred year generational debt nightmare, full of poverty, and civil unrest.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, Corbyn is just a career politician, a seasoned liar who is promising all these things to the easily pliable naive youth with limited experience of how government really works. Labour is targeting the youth simply because they are an easy target, as much as army recruiters do, they can be convinced easily with lies and half-truths, false promises interspersed with bribes. Pawns in a game of death as cannon fodder for the muddied battle field.</p>
<p>If you are a Corbyn supporter reading this, you are an ineffectual human being not worth much. You have no reasoning or logical powers, you are uneducated and follow false promises without question. To say you are a dumb animal would be an insult to animals, you are lower than that. Corbyn supporters are useless eaters, the Untermenschen of society who are deprived of a normal thought process, you are lemmings, you are slaves to a socialist system of welfare that wants to keep you dumbed down, a mere enslaved piece of detritus now given an order to vote, and you will follow your orders well, because in your brainwashed, socialist conditioned brain cell, there is no part of you that can be defined as a normal functioning human with a mind of your own. It is off to the slaughter house for you, and you will toddle off with a deranged face as your leader gently cajoles you onward.</p>
<p>For those who wake up from the conditioned rhetoric and brainwashing tones of Corbyn, well done, for the others, there is no hope for you. Willingly you will go to the showers and when the gas comes through the pipes, you will see the smiling face of Corbyn looking through the plexiglass portal. Your job is done, he will have no more need for you.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap" style="background-color: #333333;">T</span>he evil mind control techniques capitalise on the naive, low information young voters who do not understand politics or the machinations of the world yet.</p>
<p>&#8220;By targeting the youth, you are targeting a group of people who are very susceptible to believing in lies, just as long as these lies are peppered with seemingly true false promises and bribes. For example, Labour is saying that all tuition should be free, and this will help a generation of kids, however they are also not telling the kids that Britain has a deficit of £1.8 Trillion and that by adding onto the debt mountain, these kids will be paying treble for the burden in the future, as will their kids, their grandchildren, and many generations ahead,&#8221; an observer revealed.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25282" src="https://cdn-media.httpid.com/c202/2017/06/brainwash-labour.jpg" alt="brainwash labour" width="360" height="240" srcset="https://cdn-media.httpid.com/c202/2017/06/brainwash-labour.jpg 360w, https://cdn-media.httpid.com/c202/2017/06/brainwash-labour-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /></p>
<div class="td_text_columns_two_cols">
<p>Labour, is not only utilising soviet techniques of repetition to drum through their lies to the easily susceptible youth but further techniques in play include: coercion, bribery, blatant lies interspersed with bits of factual truth, ad hominem attacks on the opponent, as well as social alienation if you do not tow the party line.</p>
<p>An Oxford team of researchers has already caught out Labour using <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/06/01/exclusive-labour-election-campaign-boosted-fake-twitter-accounts/">bots on Twitter</a> to continually discredit Theresa May and the Conservatives. The millions of fake bots are set up to continually spew out hatred and derision at anything that is Tory.</p>

<p>This coupled with a youth who are easily swayed, never ask questions and are always up for free things is a recipe for disaster when it comes to an election.</p>

<p>Insiders for Momentum and anti-royalist groups like Republic are encouraged by Jeremy Corbyn&#8217;s rise in the polls, but are not giving anything away in public.</p>
<p>The plan will be to take away the Sovereign Grant which officially equates to approximately £45 million per annum. The Sovereign Grant is financed chiefly by taxpayers through the Treasury and from a percentage of the profits of the Crown Estate revenue, currently at 15%.</p>
<p>Corbyn&#8217;s reasoning for closing the Sovereign Fund will be that the Queen and the rest of the royal family receive enough monies from the Crown Estate, therefore there is no need for such a heavy burden on the Treasury where that money could be used for social welfare. The Queen can get by without the Sovereign Fund, however if she is forced to pay incoming taxation to the vast land owned by the Windsors, things will go awry.</p>
<p>From this point, the Crown Estate will also be subject to vast punitive taxation, and the Queen&#8217;s land holdings which equate to 46,000 acres of land will be subject to crushing land value taxes.</p>
<p>Eventually, the Crown estate will be whittled down to a mere shadow of its former self, leaving the royals floundering in their palaces, which will eventually be nationalised as places where the public can visit and picnic in.</p>
<p>Do not be fooled by Corbyn&#8217;s niceties during the electioneering, his intention is solely to de-fund, then eventually unseat the British royal families, who he has previously called &#8216;parasites&#8217; and &#8216;scavengers&#8217;.</p>
<p>Jeremy Corbyn <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/11/jeremy-corbyn-did-not-kneel-for-the-queen">did not kneel in front of the Queen</a> as is protocol for good reason, he fucking hates her guts, and he hates the royal family with a vengeance as a lifelong Republican.</p>
<p>It is sad to say that thousands of years of pageantry and British history could finally come to a sorry end if Labour comes into power, but like a good Bolshevik, Comrade Corbyn is on a mission, and he will not stop until it is completed, in full.</p>

<p>For an island which only makes up 93,000 square miles, in contrast, the USA has eleven states larger than the UK, we are a tiny already overcrowded land mass.</p>
<p>Our current population as of 2015 was 65.14 million, and already the roads and transport systems are at buckling point. Housing is severely in shortage, hospitals have patients stuffed in corridors and broom cupboards, and schools have 50-60 children per class.</p>
<p>104,000,000 people packed into 93,000 square miles is of course acceptable to Labour, because they obviously have no standards of living, and their chief concern will be importing future Labour voters so they stay in perpetual power for the next fifty years.</p>
<p>Imagine the massive onslaught that will be wrought on Britain with another Labour open door policy, where literally 40 million people will be welcomed into the straining pit of Britain, to make a living hell, an even more unimaginable nightmare of existence.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16276" src="https://cdn-media.httpid.com/c202/2015/12/Overpopulation_1677834c.jpg" alt="Overpopulation" width="460" height="288" srcset="https://cdn-media.httpid.com/c202/2015/12/Overpopulation_1677834c.jpg 460w, https://cdn-media.httpid.com/c202/2015/12/Overpopulation_1677834c-300x188.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px" /></p>
<p>It would be silly not to mention the massive increase in breeding by migrant populations will completely change the whole landscape of the country not only culturally but economically where poverty, shanty towns, and crime will reign. It is estimated by 2035, Britain will thus have a population of over 112 million factoring migrant breeding.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16277" src="https://cdn-media.httpid.com/c202/2015/12/Surpopulation-Afrique.jpg" alt="Surpopulation" width="460" height="276" srcset="https://cdn-media.httpid.com/c202/2015/12/Surpopulation-Afrique.jpg 460w, https://cdn-media.httpid.com/c202/2015/12/Surpopulation-Afrique-300x180.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px" /></p>
<p>There will be no NHS as funding for a free service will have been dropped many years back, schools will all have class sizes of a minimum of 180 pupils, there will be severe civil unrest as only a few people will have jobs, there will be little or no money for welfare payments, and the country will buckle under massively overcrowded transport systems. Those who live in a house will be few and far between as the massive tower blocks housing hundreds of thousands of citizens in tiny rooms will be the norm.</p>
<p>The Malthusian nightmare is welcomed by Labour, they do not care for you or the ecosphere, as they cram and cram millions of people on top of each other like rats.</p>
<p>Sadly, the misinformed idiots who are fooled into voting Labour have no idea about its policies or the consequences of what will happen under their irresponsible communist regime. If they do have an idea of what is going to happen under Jeremy Corbyn&#8217;s Labour, they are obviously masochists and sadists who welcome self-punishment with a deranged smiling face.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/24789-underestimate-corbyn-risk.html">Daily Squib warned</a> of the dangers of Jeremy Corbyn and his band of sleeper cell silent voters months ago, but of course we are never taken seriously.</p>
<p>And so, we are now at an impasse, where the anti-Brexit, Marxist, Socialist, anti-private property, high tax loving, anti-business, pro-EU contingent have hijacked the high ground.</p>
<p>It seems the awkward timid Theresa May has seriously underestimated the seething self-hatred that underlines Modern Britain today when it comes to the socialist class and their Momentum movement of communistic fervour.</p>
<p>To try and explain that the socialists plans are not economically viable is redundant, as they do not hear sense, logic or factual data. In their communist brainwashing they are completely in allegiance to the soviet EU state which is run completely by unelected eurocrats.</p>
<p>The BBC bias is to be understood, as they receive large payments from the EU. The anti-Brexit activist Gina Miller from Guyana, is financed by George Soros, and the EU. The Labour party anti-Brexit operatives like Mandelson and Blair have a hotline direct to Brussels as they engineer more plots with Lib Dem vile traitors like Nick Clegg and Tim Farron.</p>
<p>Casting a shadow over Britain today is a PM fighting for her life, in a very subdued way. She does not seem to exude much passion or energy seeing as the polls are now showing a major movement towards the Marxist Labour party led by Jeremy Corbyn.</p>
<p><strong>False promises</strong></p>
<p>Instead of leading with a passionate Brexit strategy during campaigning, May instead talked about dementia, or other social issues which are low on scale of things to be done. She should have rallied the troops instead of turning left, and this is why she is now in a pit, having taken a gamble that may unseat the Tories.</p>
<p>It is evident that socialists do not care how much debt they put Britain in to fund their vast welfare spending drive. The only alarm bells that will ring is when all the money runs out, as happened in the last Labour government.</p>
<p><strong>From a 22 point lead to minus 5</strong></p>
<p>We may get a hung parliament, we may get a Labour majority in parliament, and from this mess, we may get a lesson in humility, that the silent majority in this country now who rear their heads only on election day are the millions of migrants let in by Blair, the millions of unemployable staunch communists, and the millions of disaffected brainwashed youth who march to the red sock sandalled step of Jeremy Corbyn.</p>
<p>June the 8th, will thus be an important election, because it may mean the loss of Brexit, the loss of private property in the UK, the loss of the royal family, the loss of business, the loss of entrepreneurial spirit, and ultimately the loss of Britain as a viable free nation.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not only the rich with their vast gardens that will be hit hard, but the middle classes, pensioners and those trying to get on the property ladder. Even if you have a mid terraced property with a tiny garden, depending on the area you live in you will be paying over £4,500 per annum.</p>
<p>In Westminster local tax would rise a massive 2,300 per cent to £17,413 at the highest end.</p>
<p><span class="m_first-letter m_first-letter--flagged">I</span>n Kensington and Chelsea, where the average home is worth £1.4m, town hall taxes would jump from £1,208 to £23,213, an increase of £22,005, or 1,821 per cent.</p>
<p>One of the poorest council areas of England &#8211; Barking and Dagenham &#8211; would see hard pressed council tax payers faced with an average bill of more than 500 per cent more at £4,579 a year.</p>
<p>Jeremy Corbyn, a staunch communist Marxist has included the Land Value Tax in the Labour manifesto, and will implement the deadly tax on households as early as September  this year, once in power, leaving little or no time to sell up before the tax is implemented.</p>
<p>Not only will the Land Value Tax affect the most vulnerable in society and pensioners, but the tax will be exercised on farm land, thus increasing the price of food enormously.</p>
<p>Vegetables, bread, egg and milk prices will rise by an estimated 250% within the first year of the Labour tax and continue to rise year on year.</p>
<p>Naturally with such large costs incurred on homeowners, many will not be able to pay and repossessions will increase. Accompanied with the high rise of food costs in the UK, many will fall into poverty, which is what Jeremy Corbyn and his evil communist apparatchiks want.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>The watered down version of Anarcho-Communist ideology that Corbyn adheres to essentially will mean the abolition of private property for all and common ownership of the means of production.</p>
<p>Essentially under the Corbyn Sovietized regime, Britain would become a communist state where a network of voluntary associations and workers&#8217; councils with production and consumption based on the guiding principle: &#8220;from each according to his ability, to each according to his need&#8221; would rule.</p>
<p>The Royal family would be abolished within the second or third year of the Corbyn Ten Year Plan. The process of de-funding the royal purse will commence slowly and almost unseen to the public, until legislation will be passed to completely de-fund the royal family in its entirety. All royal palaces and property will become property of the state, and deemed for the people.</p>
<p>Faced with tax bills of over 90% for the wealthy, many will leave these shores and take their wealth elsewhere. The time to start planning for this is now as the Labour party is already 5 points within the Conservatives according to recent polls. The brain drain will leave Britain without doctors, surgeons, scientists, and all other professional class, as well as entrepreneurial business.</p>
<p>The assumption that Labour will raise funds by taxing the rich within an inch of their lives is absolutely ridiculous, as many will go offshore to preserve their wealth. How is Corbyn going to fund his &#8216;free everything for everyone&#8217; society when the majority of wealth moves out of the UK? All foreign investment into the UK will also cease as many are deterred by the inhibitive taxation system of the Labour government.</p>
<p>The mass exodus, and brain drain out of Britain will leave only the poor and struggling middle classes who will then be pulled into welfare poverty by the ever increasing tax demands of the welfare state.</p>

<p>Labour&#8217;s ridiculous plans for tax hikes aimed at top earners and businesses will &#8220;not raise anything like&#8221; the £48.6 billion claimed and their proposals could turn out to be &#8220;economically damaging&#8221;, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has warned.</p>
<p>Britain is already suffering under a deficit of £1.2 Trillion, which was incurred by the Labour governments of Brown and Blair. With further budget black holes, funding for the NHS and crucial elements like schools, prisons, utilities will be non existent.</p>
<figure id="attachment_22770" style="width: 295px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-22770 size-full" src="https://cdn-media.httpid.com/c202/files/cat_117/1708.jpg" alt="" width="295" height="234" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Soviet housing will make every Briton equal</figcaption></figure>
<p>Many will flee a Corbyn Britain of misery, no hope, civil unrest, mass poverty, violence and hardship. Do you want to bring your kids up in a country where there will be little or no police on the streets, no safety, no aspiration, no hope for the future, a bleak soviet landscape of grey damp rat infested concrete blocks crammed with millions of people?</p>
<p>A Corbyn Britain will be a dark place where many would rather kill themselves or leave forever rather than live another day in the communist hell where every part of your life is dictated to you by the state, where your every penny is snatched out of your pocket to fund some utopian dream that has never been realised in human history.</p>
<p>If you own any sort of property, business or wealth&#8230;start thinking about leaving right now before it is too late. Unfortunately, the insipid Tory election campaign has given Britain&#8217;s communists a huge leap in the polls, endangering the safety of the nation.</p>

<p>Many of these vile theories are being bandied around on twitter by Corbyn supporters, who are frankly deranged in their despicable, thoughtless conspiracies, especially in a time of mourning for the dead.</p>
<p>One Corbyn supporter said: &#8220;Theresa May arranged MI5 to let the suicide bomber go ahead with the bombing so it will bring support to the Tory scum government.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another deranged maniac, and Corbyn supporter said: &#8220;Tory scum committed the bombing and planted the evidence on site. They want to change the election when we were winning.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thankfully the tweets were removed after much outrage from other more sane twitter readers.</p>
<p>However, this episode does throw some light into the type of people who are supporting Jeremy Corbyn, they are maniacal, deranged with low IQs, and are not only staunch Marxist communists but pathetic losers of the worst kind.</p>
<p>As for the likes of Tina Buckley, a Corbyn agitator and activist, her calling Theresa May a terrorist is quite hypocritical as it is her master Jeremy Corbyn, who <a href="https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/25201-innocent-civilians-killed-ira-jeremy-corbyn-laughed.html">supports Hamas and the IRA</a>. If you vote for Jeremy Corbyn, you are clinically insane.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>Thanks to Tony Blair&#8217;s <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3466499/Conman-betrayed-Britain-immigration-utterly-amoral-PM-led-conspiracy-let-MILLIONS-migrants-breaking-rules-deceiving-public.html">open door policy</a> where over <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/8339075/More-than-three-million-migrants-under-Labour.html">3 million people entered Britain</a> with little or no checks under the Labour government, the cat is already out of the bag. Little or nothing can be done about the daily reports of terrorist carnage, whether homegrown or from abroad.</p>
<p>More unfettered migration, death and mayhem will come if you vote for Labour&#8217;s Jeremy Corbyn. Controlled migration is okay, as is multiculturism that is controlled and moderated. Corbyn espouses the exact opposite.</p>
<p>On June 8, people are being cajoled into voting for Corbyn by the use of bountiful election bribes and benefit payment promises that have no standing in economic reality, but some low-information voters may fall for the tricks.</p>
<p>Do not vote for Jeremy Corbyn, his <a href="http://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/715108/Labour-leader-Jeremy-Corbyn-relaxed-migration-immigration">election promise</a> is to let in as many more people as he can, and this unlimited number will surely tip the boat over creating large instances of civil unrest, terrorism and more terrorism.</p>
<p>Think about the mangled corpses of the children in the foyer of the music venue in Manchester when you are at the ballot box, because Corbyn does not care for your children, as Tony Blair never did. In fact, their policies and election promises reveal the opposite, other children from other countries are preferred over British children by the Labour government, where the word &#8216;<a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/2005/07/the-lefts-war-on-britishness/#">British</a>&#8216; is frowned upon, and spat out in vile disregard.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25221" src="https://cdn-media.httpid.com/c202/2017/05/manchester-arena-bloody-victims.jpeg" alt="manchester-arena-bloody-victims" width="718" height="559" srcset="https://cdn-media.httpid.com/c202/2017/05/manchester-arena-bloody-victims.jpeg 718w, https://cdn-media.httpid.com/c202/2017/05/manchester-arena-bloody-victims-300x234.jpeg 300w, https://cdn-media.httpid.com/c202/2017/05/manchester-arena-bloody-victims-600x467.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 718px) 100vw, 718px" /></p>
<p>Not only do Jeremy Corbyn&#8217;s policies spit at any form of Britishness, but they defile the memories of the long gone war dead who fought for Britain&#8217;s freedom in World War II and are a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-politics-34231727/defence-secretary-michael-fallon-corbyn-a-risk-to-security">threat</a> to the country&#8217;s national security.</p>
<p>A vote for Corbyn&#8217;s Marxist Labour policies is a vote for a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/05/venezuela-western-socialists-nicolas-maduro-abuse">Venezuela</a> in Britain. For poverty to be extended through benefits the government and taxpayer cannot afford to pay out, for a rise in population where the green belt is bulldozed and large grey socialist tenements are built blighting the once English lush countryside forever. Once it&#8217;s gone, it&#8217;s gone, and it will never come back.</p>
<p>The terrorists will have a holiday under Corbyn rule, simply because <a href="https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/25201-innocent-civilians-killed-ira-jeremy-corbyn-laughed.html">Corbyn supports terrorism</a>. Wherever you go in Britain will not be safe any more, a land targeted by the terrorists for the easy lacklustre manner of Jeremy Corbyn. They will laugh in his face and take him for a ride, they will bomb, and bomb away, as he offers them a <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/labour/12199570/British-soldiers-should-have-cups-of-tea-with-Islamic-State-terrorists-says-Jeremy-Corbyn-ally.html">cup of tea</a> and some biscuits.</p>
<p>Your Labour vote is for more mangled corpses splattered on the floor of a children&#8217;s pop concert. You should be fucking ashamed of yourself if you even dare to vote Labour ever again.</p>
<p>Britain must never forget what Labour did to Britain under Blair and Brown. <strong>Never forget.</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4531940/Emergency-services-rush-Manchester-Arena.html">terrorist</a> who exploded a nail bomb at a concert packed with little girls last night was well known to the police and MI5, as was the individual who attacked parliament last month. Therefore, in the interests of public safety, it is not good enough to monitor known threats to the public, but to detain these individuals indefinitely.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, because of the EU open border Schengen system, many returning Jihadis from the war zones of Syria have returned to their Western European places of abode, and they have been told to inflict damage on the population by their ISIS commanders and media. This can be circumnavigated by adopting proper procedures at points of entry, where these known Jihadis are detained indefinitely on arrival.</p>
<p>The UK, and USA must lead in the fight, and the only way to stop the violence is unfortunately through total violence against those who wish harm on the West purely based on an ideology that is skewed and immovable.</p>
<p>By mobilising troops, and the totality of naval plus air forces onto Syria, the cleansing of the area could be completed within months with the correct troop numbers. There may have to be a draft in the UK, and USA, which would bolster the current troop numbers including reserves. The key point to note is that the regime of Assad would end, and ISIS as well as the numerous other factions would be removed indefinitely.</p>
<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PN_us-YBMZM" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is interesting to see Donald Trump visiting the Wahabi state of Saudi Arabia and bowing to the royal family, when much of the ideology, monetary support and belief system for ISIS comes from that country.</p>
<p>It is yet unclear which member states are the key funders of ISIS also giving them weapon support, and intelligence. One must first look at who benefits from this terror group, cui bono? On the ground, ISIS are murdering more Muslims than any other group, of these mainly Shias bear the brunt. The Shias in Syria are supported by Iran and Russia, and the Sunnis by mainly the Gulf states and possibly Israeli clandestine operations, but that is pure speculation. The key to Syria is Iran, and the power play here also extends to Turkey, which as a crucial point in the geo-political territorial game is a very powerful player.</p>
<p>This is where the quandary lies, by defeating ISIS completely, the West plays into the hands of Iran and Russia, who will extend their territorial advantage over Syria and Iraq. To not defeat ISIS and carry on arming them as the previous U.S. president was doing, only buys time in an increasingly volatile situation. Therefore, the only real course of action is to defeat not only the Iranian backed insurgents, to annihilate Assad, and to destroy ISIS completely, whilst hoping that Russia/Iran backs away, which is highly unlikely.</p>
<p>If everything is put on the ground right now, including a population of drafted military personnel from the ages of 18-35, the problem could be solved relatively quickly. It is now up to the leaders of Western nations to either kick the can further down the road, and continue to be bombarded by terrorists, and their cities drowned by fleeing refugees from war zones, or to end the conflict once and for all.</p>
<p>The play is up to you, and only you can make the key decisions, but until that time, the terrorist atrocities and attacks will continue on a weekly, monthly basis. No musical venue, no public place or sports stadium will be safe.</p>
<p>The advantages of mobilising a vast ground war is that the defence industry and economy will also find a massive boost. The military draft is the only answer to this problem and must be administered immediately.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like I&#8217;m invisible. This is why I have to tweet every few minutes to show people I am around. When I am on screen maybe they don&#8217;t see or hear me,&#8221; the Donald said, with tears streaming down his face.</p>
<p>What about the goddamn Russians? They seem to have been a thorn in the side of the Don since the beginning of the election campaign.</p>
<p>&#8220;Talking to Russians ain&#8217;t a bad thing. I talk to people from all over. Like I talk with those people from Africa, I talk to Israel, and I talk to North Korea, does not mean a thing. These Libtards got it against me at every turn and want an excuse to impeach me,&#8221; Trump added.</p>
<p>The president records every conversation that occurs in the White House, and do does the FBI, who seem to have the Donald firmly in their sights.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s see, I fire that kook Comey, now he goes crying to the dems, and they continue their little investigation. Last I heard, I was the president, the fucking king, I order these people not the other way round!&#8221; a thumping fist on the Oval room table resounds.</p>
<p>Something has to be done by the Don sharpish or he really will end up on the wrong end of the stick.</p>
<p><strong>Purge the system</strong></p>
<p>Back when he was first announced as the winner of the election, the Squib <a href="https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/21291-trump-invigorates-new-american-volk-by-formulating-u-s-einsatzgruppen.html">advised</a> the Don to clean house, like fire all the socialist whining Obamamites embedded in the FBI, CIA ,IRS, DoD, etc, etc.. That is the only way the Don is going to survive a presidency. Don&#8217;t speak to any press that is under the leftwing bias, don&#8217;t fucking tweet any more. You are the president, you are meant to be elusive, decisive and very secretive. By tweeting your every brain fart, you not only give away your every intention to your enemies but you add fuel to the fire and obstruct the workings of your team.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t listen to the Squib Donald, who the fuck are you going to trust?</p>
<p>Remember Drain the swamp, Build the wall, Throw out the illegals, Ban the Muslims, and let&#8217;s have a war for a change. Yes, a good ol&#8217; shoot out with some terrorist loving country, and we&#8217;re not talking a civil war, we&#8217;re talking either Syria or N.Korea. Listen to Henry, he comes around, talks to you in the office, listen to him and take his advice.</p>
<p>Just do it.</p>

<p>Here is a man of fascist Nazi stock, his father, Joseph, a devout Nazi who joined Hitler&#8217;s army during the World War II invasion of Russia, was most certainly part of the wholesale murder of many Russian civilians including women and children.</p>
<p>Juncker&#8217;s father-in-law, Louis Mathias Frising — dad to Juncker’s wife of 35 years<br />
Christiane — was a teacher in Ettelbruck, Luxembourg, when the Germans<br />
invaded in 1940.</p>
<p>Frising volunteered to be a Nazi propaganda chief while banning spoken French<br />
in favour of German.</p>
<p>He was also responsible for enforcing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Laws">Nuremberg Laws</a> which stripped Jews of their<br />
rights and professions — the first stage of the Holocaust.</p>
<p>Juncker&#8217;s five year term as unelected president of the EU Commission will net him <a href="http://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/485712/EU-chief-to-pocket-1-8million">£1.8 million</a>, a tidy sum with all the many perks of the job, a gold plated pension plan and housing allowance.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a nice job if you can get it. You answer to no one, drink as much booze as you want, and get to pick the prettiest young escorts you want, plus you get paid for it,&#8221; an EU insider revealed.</p>
<p>When he is rarely not drunk, Juncker has moments of clarity, but these moments are very rare. He is said to enjoy a few glasses of the best cognac for breakfast, and much more throughout the day.</p>
<p>When it comes to Brexit, Juncker is a gifted liar, and has no qualms in stitching Britain up, he hates the English with a profound vehemence, and will do anything to ruin the country.</p>
<p>This man is dangerous, vindictive, untrustworthy and inherently nasty with little or no conscience, and these attributes to his vile psychopathic character give fuel to Brexit, so we must be thankful for their abundance.</p>
<p>Quoting Juncker also reveals much of his character:</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>According to reports from Hollywood, this film stands to lose $150 million at the box office.</p>
<p>Imagine a bunch of wide boys in medieval England a la Lock, Stock and Barrel, maybe plonk in a footballer somewhere or a few other cockney bastards, then give them GQ photoshoot renderings of medieval clothes and a horse to run up and down hills shouting incoherent gibberish, all the while edited with the same old Guy Ritchie camera movement clichés.</p>
<p>Guy Ritchie always uses the same old techniques to film his movies, utilising high-speed photography to slow things down at critical moments, as well as wipes here and everywhere, you don&#8217;t know where to look as the camera zips around at break neck speed. Stick a go-pro on the shoulders of a group of people running, speed it up, slow it down, all for a measly $175 million.</p>
<p>Super quick cuts is the norm in a Guy Ritchie film, afterwards, if you don&#8217;t have a searing fucking headache, you haven&#8217;t been watching. There are no long meandering shots, or John Huston-esque  panoramic landscapes, no, not in a Ritchie film, where the only qualification one needs to watch one is to either be on methamphetamine or suffer from severe attention deficit disorder.</p>
<p>Ritchie also likes to stick in narrators in practically every scene, usually some cockney gangster type who starts spouting rhyming slang all over the fucking place, something the Americans watching probably will never get. Everyone&#8217;s got a quip or a quick fire answer in a Ritchie film, thus making the whole movie&#8217;s dialogue into something resembling a pub quiz in Bethnal Green on a Thursday night.</p>
<p>The gratuitous insertions of token blacks would never be seen in medieval England, but it&#8217;s necessary in today&#8217;s politically correct Hollywoodized pathetic mediocre pap, and Ritchie has obviously bowed to the pressure.</p>
<p>If you can get through that minefield of cinematic cliché, wait until you try and follow the plot, or multiple useless plots usually put in a top hat, mixed around and spewed onto the screen as an incomprehensible mish mash of incoherent fast scenes, speeded up film, flashbacks, and ridiculous characters talking the same old tired shit they did in the last Guy Ritchie film. Add in the pathetic cast, including celebrity underwear model David Beckham and you have a recipe so dire that even people with little or no standards will start to question themselves in seeing this crap. If you&#8217;re going to see it, simply key in the film&#8217;s title alongside the words &#8216;123 movies&#8217; or &#8216;putlocker&#8217; and you can watch for free. Do not under any circumstances think of giving these idiots any money for this farce.</p>
<p>The only good thing about Guy Ritchie&#8217;s new film is that Madonna is not in it.</p>

<p>The virus demands Britain pays the hacking group £85 billion in Bitcoins or all data on the computers will be deleted.</p>
<p>GCHQ has identified one of the hackers as a guy called Juncky, his real name is Jean Claude Juncker, who is well known to the authorities as a very dangerous malevolent joker character.</p>
<p><b>Ransomware</b></p>
<p>&#8220;We have tracked this hacking group to a building in Brussels, Belgium. Juncky and his crew are a highly dangerous team of experts in the field of blackmail, extortion and many other criminal activities,&#8221; Miles Eaveridge, senior cyber crimes analyst at MI6 revealed today.</p>

<p>&#8220;Free hand jobs for every migrant, Free Lamborghinis for every school leaver, dance lessons for convicted murderers, no prisons, no poverty ever again because everything will be free, and 20 million more police officers.&#8221;</p>
<p>This sort of madness can only be dreamed up by a maniacal Trotskyite Marxist deranged madman like Jeremy Corbyn, a person who does not realise that there are costs for things, and there are budgets that governments have to adhere to.</p>
<p>The UK is already £1.2 Trillion in debt thanks to the previous Labour government, and yet in this new manifesto, it seems that not one lesson was ever learned by the grotesque useless spending of the past years. You can&#8217;t just give people free stuff, someone has to pay for this shit, but the high earners are the Labour target, so if you tax them to death, what incentive is there for aspiration, innovation or growth &#8212; none.</p>
<p>Corbyn would ideally like to nationalise all private property, and that&#8217;s including your home which you have worked and scraped for years to acquire. He also wants to bring the trade unions into Number 10, which would be a disaster for all business and enterprise in the UK.</p>
<p>As for migration, it&#8217;s a big fucking open door for Corbyn&#8217;s Marxist Momentum movement. People in Britain are already heaped up on top of each other like rats, you can&#8217;t drive on the traffic filled narrow British roads any more, and here is this guy inviting the rest of Sub Saharan Africa, the Middle East and South East Asia into the tiny Isle of Britain. There&#8217;s not enough square feet of land for that, what are you going to do, have people hanging from trees and digging underground?</p>
<p>The ludicrous Labour manifesto is so over the top that even a Venezuelan tin pot socialist dictator would baulk at it, and yet the lemmings who do not question, who do not look at other sources, or basically cannot count accept this shit without even a drop of logical, perceptive thought. How insane that socialists can be this fucking dumb, that they are some sort of robotic &#8216;yes&#8217; monkey, with no ability to see through the lies and bullshit.</p>
<p>A post-Corbyn government according to the Marxist socialists will have everyone as equal, which in human term is impossible, but they just do not get it. How can you have a rocket scientist and a street sweeper as equal?</p>
<p>The hypocrisy of socialists and communists is that they live in a highly unequal society, where high party officials have their own lanes on roads, their own shops, and they send their children to the best private schools, the rest of the proles are all equal in shite, in poverty and derision.</p>
<p>Socialism also creates poverty, because it normalises it, and it encourages those in poverty to stay in poverty by giving them benefit payments to do so. This is a never ending generational cycle of poverty that can only be broken by proper education, enterprise and a market where capitalistic competition is present.</p>
<p>Anyone who has any sense would run a thousand miles away from Corbyn, but to do so you would have to possess an education, and knowledge of history, as well as a honed sense of logic, which socialists do not possess.</p>
<p>You socialist do-gooder poseurs are merely posturing, when it comes to the crunch you are more racist than conservatives, more un-progressive, and pander to soviet political correctness, censorship.</p>
<p>Let us hope for Britain&#8217;s sake we never see a Labour government ever again, for it is with this unholy pathetic misadventure that will push the country deep into the mire to never recover from the path it has taken.</p>
<p>If you want chaos, death, and poverty, please vote for Jeremy Corbyn&#8217;s Britain, because under his watch after he invites another 80% of the third world into the country, there will be no NHS, no schools or places to live.</p>
<p>This place is already full, and by piling rats upon rats, eventually they start to eat each other. That is Labour&#8217;s Britain, a festering polluted vomit prison where humans are piled upon each other by the million, all the grass is now mud and excrement and over the collective moaning you will hear the voice of Corbyn saying how wonderful life is under socialism. Fuck you Corbyn. Never, never, never shall you be allowed to create your Marxist utopia that never existed in human history or will ever exist.</p>
<p>Socialism and Communism have been responsible for over 140 million human deaths throughout history, and this is the crux of the whole situation, they murdered those people for their ideology and party. Who is to say it won&#8217;t happen again?</p>

<p>&#8220;He kinda has a weird accent when he speaks,&#8221; one clueless CNN journalist commented during the grand unveiling.</p>
<p>Not many people have been able to figure out who the new FBI director would be, but on Thursday, to a packed press office, the deed was done to much head scratching.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe I have seen this guy&#8217;s face somewhere before but cannot place it at the moment. He&#8217;s not very tall but I&#8217;ve heard he is a great friend of Trump&#8217;s and helped him immensely during the election,&#8221; another journalist said.</p>
<p>Taking the podium, the newly appointed FBI  director, Brad Poutin, seemed resolute and determined to treat the job just like any other he has had in the past.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a saying from where I come. If it can&#8217;t be solved with words, it can be solved with polonium and a troupe of hackers. I would first like to thank my great friend, Donald Trump, who I have known for many years, as have my business associates and other agencies, of which I cannot mention here. I will endeavour to do my best for your country, ahem, I mean my country to solve all the crimes and whatnot. You know what I mean, okay thank you, I have to go now, there are many people I need to deal with, i.e. put them underground. Spasibo!&#8221;</p>

<p>Launching the party&#8217;s General Election Soviet manifesto in Manchester, Comrade Corbyn said Labour will &#8220;ruin&#8221; the country as he launched an all-out attack on the wealthiest in society.</p>
<p>&#8220;Comrades, I was sitting in my dacha last week and thought to myself, this is it, this is the only chance we have to let the ruling classes tremble at a communist revolution. The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win. Workingmen of all countries, unite!&#8221;</p>
<p>The thunderous words coming from the Comrade brought cheers from party officials as they shouted &#8216;Hail! Comrade Corbyn! Supreme Soviet Marxist!&#8217; and &#8216;Three cheers for the Supreme Comrade Corbyn. Death to the bourgeoisie!&#8217;.</p>
<p>Corbyn then continued his speech with great vitriol: &#8220;From each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs. For the many, not the few. The rich will do anything for the poor but get off their backs. We will abolish all private property. We will nationalise all business. We will stop threatening our friends in Russia and China by disarming ourselves of all nuclear deterrents. Soviet Britain shall be a communist utopia where every one will have equal wealth, equal healthcare, and equal opportunities in living a live of extreme poverty. After I am in power, I will also abolish all elections, as I as the supreme Soviet am good enough for you for the next 50 years.</p>
<p>&#8220;Capital is reckless of the health or length of life of the labourer, unless under compulsion from society. You are horrified at our intending to do away with private property. But in your existing society private property is already done away with for nine-tenths of the population; its existence for the few is solely due to its non-existence in the hands of those nine-tenths. You reproach us, therefore, with intending to do away with a form of property, the necessary condition for whose existence is the non-existence of any property for the immense majority of society.</p>
<p>&#8220;In one word, you reproach us with intending to do away with your property. Precisely so: that is just what we intend.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rapturous applause and hoots of joy erupt from the assembled crowd.</p>
<p>It seems the revolution has only just begun&#8230;</p>

<p>Facebook has over 40% of its profiles as bots, either dormant fake accounts or attack bots that embed malicious software onto your computer when you click on anything on a page. That massive advertising budget some company is blowing for those famous &#8216;targeted&#8217; customers only falls on mostly fake Facebook accounts or bots.</p>
<p>There are literally trillions of bots flying around the internet doing all sorts of nasty shit, from hacking your site, looking for vulnerabilities or stealing your info so some Romanian hacker can get housing benefit for three fake families in Stoke Newington and keep the money for himself.</p>
<p>I bought a fake Rolex from a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8178959.stm">fake shopping site</a> on the internet a few minutes ago. The contact address says the business is in London, but doing a Whois search shows that it is in fact a Chinese site. They just took my money and I will never get it back. Good thing I was using a fake bank account and I joined a fake get rich MLM site so I&#8217;ll be rolling in the fake money soon.</p>
<p>Want a larger penis or a tighter vagina, buy a fake bottle of fake pills that contain nothing but flour and a few additives, possibly conjured up in some dirty remote village in the Xinjiang region of China. At $120 per bottle, someone is raking it in from dumb idiots all over the fake fucking internet.</p>
<p>The fake does not stop there though, it extends to <a href="http://www.which.co.uk/news/2016/02/fake-and-suspicious-profiles-rife-on-dating-sites-432850/">dating sites</a>, where studies have shown some cruel sites entice men with fake women profiles, of course anyone with any sense would be able to see this but thousands of suckers are suckered in to the trap every day and they go ahead with that never-ending expensive subscription.</p>
<p>The internet is now so fake that even so-called trusted sites like Wikipedia are changing whole swathes of history just for a bit of PR for someone&#8217;s benefit. Or how about that <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4042194/Facebook-fact-checker-arbitrate-fake-news-accused-defrauding-website-pay-prostitutes-staff-includes-escort-porn-star-Vice-Vixen-domme.html">Snopes</a> site that some people in charge think is so great, it is run by a former prostitute/porn actress and sleazy convicted defrauding scumbag thief, ahh, nothing wrong with that you say, but listen, would you trust anything that comes out of their shitty fake site?</p>
<p>Even the mainstream media has been faking it, they fake their numbers, they fake their viewer figures and some times they fake their news. <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3716151.stm">Piers Morgan</a>, who was the editor of the Daily Mirror before he was sacked for faking on a large scale, knows about that. Lest we forget Johann Hari, who led a very respectable career as a journalistic star before being revealed as a <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/twitter/8605603/Johann-Hari-faces-more-plagiarism-claims.html">complete and utter fake news faker</a>. American journalism is some of the most fake news there is, what with fake haircut fake tan news touting chaps like <a href="http://variety.com/2015/tv/news/brian-williams-false-iraq-war-story-1201424120/">Brian Williams</a>, an NBC news anchor who eventually ended up in the sizzler.</p>
<p>How about a fake <a href="http://www.fakenewschecker.com/" rel="nofollow">fakenewschecker</a>. Yep, it exists, and it disseminates fake fake news checking from an anonymous website, with no references and no relevance. They have even included our site, with fake links to other sites yet claiming they are our stories. You can&#8217;t get more fake than that. One site even researched <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2017/02/fake-news-checker-publishes-fake-news/">fakenewschecker.com</a> finding out it is hosted somewhere in Austria or Germany, possibly a Russian disinfo site, or one of Putin&#8217;s many fake news factories created it.</p>
<p>The fakery does not stop in governmental lies, press releases or propaganda, we have fake fear news, yes, you read that right. <a href="https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/19124-project-fear-definition-sanctioned-institutional-terrorism-using-fear-tool-control-masses.html">Project Fear</a> was a fake media propaganda push by the pro-EU UK government during the EU referendum, and its role was to put the fear of living shit out of people who thought about leaving the EU. Sure, it backfired in the end as most people saw through the bollocks, but it is a prime example of fake news, fake fear, fake everything.</p>
<p>The only thing that&#8217;s not fake is ironically <a href="https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/satire">satire</a>, and of course, the Daily Squib must be included with this statement.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#8217;m off to cuddle up to my fake girlfriend, listen to fake news on my fake stereo from China, and watch a fake film about the fake moon landing whilst she fakes a fake orgasm or four.</p>

<p>&#8220;The French surrender easily to their German masters, so it is no surprise that Macron would win against the resistance. What we have in effect, is another Vichy government while France is under occupation,&#8221; an election observer revealed.</p>
<p>It is not just the ideological slant of the French to socialism and its brutish father, communism, but the Germans have since World War II been allied in their own special way.</p>
<p>Instead of allying with the British who liberated them in 1944, the French have chosen to side with their eternal oppressors. It must be a sado-masochistic streak that somehow makes up the Gallic constitution.</p>
<p>The French of course turned a blind eye during the war when the little Jewish children were picked off from their schools and sent to concentration camps, never to be seen again. After all, it was the Catholic thing to do, plus after surrendering so easily to the Germans without a shot being fired, a coward keeps their mouth shut.</p>

<p>Paris, untouched by any bomb or bullet was thus an idyllic WW2 playground for the Bosch and their French underlings. The whore houses were full, bristling with business, the cafes resplendent with German SS officers and the quaint boulevards bristled with the joie de vivre.</p>
<p>The EU has once again crushed the small pocket of French resistance. It is quite ironic, that this time, the French resistance was labelled with fascistic terms, and those who fought bravely against the German fascists of WW2 all those years ago were otherwise.</p>
<p>How the pendulum has swung, however, one thing has always stayed constant with the French, and that is their servitude to their Germanic masters.</p>
<p>Vivre le surrender!</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re going to be doing stand-up&#8221;, one man told him at a royal lunch on Thursday. &#8220;Well, I can&#8217;t  literally stand up much, so they&#8217;ve arranged for my favourite armchair to sit in whilst doing the stand up&#8221; the duke quipped.</p>
<p>The duke will attend comedy venues across the country and sit on an armchair before he doles out his infamous funny lashing quips at today&#8217;s celebrities, regions he visits and unsuspecting members of the audience.</p>
<p>The Queen &#8220;may attend some of the comedy shows just to see if she comes up in the subject matter, if so, there could be some fisticuffs at home&#8221;, the palace said.</p>
<p>As the majority of comedians in Britain today are socialist Labour voting leftists with agendas punching upwards towards the haves of society, it may be a breath of fresh air to see the grand old Duke punching down some of these oiks who revel in their champagne socialist hypocrisy so well.</p>

<p>&#8220;We saw that guy, he was treated worse than an animal being pulled by those burly thugs just so they could have a member of staff take his seat. It would definitely be exciting, maybe tie a bungee cord to your seat so when they drag you out shtooom you fly back in,&#8221; Brad Mycine, 21, an avid extreme sports fan told Fox News.</p>
<p>The way that some airline passengers are treated has always been a fascinating topic, however to pull people by their hair or legs off a flight is a next step in brutality.</p>
<p>Psychologist Dan Barnes tried to explain why United Airlines would do such a thing.</p>
<p>&#8220;They just don&#8217;t care, literally they don&#8217;t give a shit about paying passengers. They see so many every day, it&#8217;s like nothing to them to drag one off a plane. They&#8217;re conditioned over many years to not care or feel anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>One board member for United Airlines said: &#8220;The fuckers are lucky we don&#8217;t drag them off the plane at 35,000 feet.&#8221;</p>

<p>According to reports from assembled revellers and science enthusiasts, the fight was started over who gets the most amount of air time on TV shows as experts in the field of science.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Know it all</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://mkaku.org/">Kaku</a> was bragging that he gets paid to discuss fantastic scientific future events on TV sometimes three or four times a day to dumb but fascinated Americans, when Dawkins came in with a right hook connecting just below Kaku&#8217;s chin. Then Dawkins started spouting book sales numbers, and saying he was the real scientist and not some game show performing monkey like Kaku. This is when it went to the next level, Kaku who is Japanese, suddenly connected with a karate punch to Dawkins&#8217; balls and the fight was over,&#8221; Bella Donna, a science enthusiast who attended the event, told New Scientist magazine.</p>
<p>Sadly the book signing was cut short due to the fracas and the police swooping on the two scientists.</p>
<p>One astrophysicist present said: &#8220;At least they should have discussed something more scientific. I can understand a heated debate about dark energy or perhaps where that pesky baryonic matter resides, or what caused the re-ionization of the universe 13 billion years ago. What a bunch of poseurs. It&#8217;s a good thing Stephen Hawkins was not present, he would have had both of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We were on a field trip to the Highlands. You know to soak in the Scottish spirit of the wild. I noticed that Ms Sturgeon looked a little bloated. Without a word, she farted and this fish smell hit us. It was like a caviar smell that has gone off. Anyway, next thing we know she&#8217;s rushing down the water&#8217;s edge near the reeds. She lifts her skirt and plops down in the freezing waters. We rushed over to see if she was all right, when these big black eggs started to fill the water. Her eyes turned upwards as she let out this god awful gurgling sound. Sturgeon was laying them from her bottom or some att, not sure.&#8221; Bruce McCollery, SNP deputy in charge of PR, told the Scotland Times.</p>
<p>Much to the delight of the assembled SNP troupe, it all turned out well.</p>
<p>&#8220;Luckily, one of us had some crème fraîche, and crackers with some Pouilly-Fuissé, we scooped the lot up, munching away and then it hit us. We could use Nicola Sturgeon to get Scotland out of this financial mess so we could leave England. We are going to use her to cultivate expensive caviar. Who needs a fish farm when you&#8217;ve got her, she nearly filled up the whole lake with eggs. We could sell &#8217;em to rich Californians for a packet,&#8221; Mr. McCollery added.</p>
<p>Coming soon to the plates of the rich and famous, a plate load of Nicola Sturgeon eggs excreted from her fat and productive duille.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will not bow down to American imperialist aggression and our amazing air force is on standby to shoot the Americans wherever we see them. They will not even get close to our shores and their tin pot ships will be sunk to the bottom of the ocean,&#8221; Ling Fuk Yu, the North Korean air force commander in chief told state news services on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The North Korean air force is a deadly opponent that should not be underestimated. With a fleet of three aircraft and a dozen home made flying contraptions that have a top speed of 16 mph, the U.S. will soon realise they have made a huge mistake.</p>
<p>Despotic communist leader, Kim Jong-un was on hand to inspect the air force later on in the day.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will crush the Americans. I see all of you young pilots ready for action in order to defend our nation of heroes. All twenty three of you are heroes. You will give your lives for your supreme leader and country. Now excuse me while I am driven to my bunker. Goodbye.&#8221;</p>

Everyone in this world is just born the way they are and we should let people exist even if their skin colour is dark like dirt,&#8221; EDL leader Ian Crossland, told the BBC after the march.</p>
<p>So, what prompted such a drastic change of heart? According to reports, a young Asian lady turned up and simply smiled at the group of EDL supporters.</p>
<p>&#8220;She was smiling, and you could see she was not scared of the hate mob. It was incredible. I saw one EDL guy simply sit down on the grass crying. The leader of the group says he is now in love and the happy couple are to marry next month,&#8221; one bemused onlooker recalled.</p>

<p>In a world where religion is all encompassing and infects every part of human consciousness and culture, it is a pertinent question that begs to be answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Before humans inhabited the planet en masse, there were only animals. These animals went about their daily business without gods, religions or prophets. It was only when man gained full consciousness and the ability to linguistically articulate that gods and prophets were introduced to the human condition.</p>
<p>&#8220;This incredible moment of creating gods was to compensate for the unknown. Here was man, under the stars looking up into this great black mass and it was unknown. Anything unknown is a superstitious jump in the human brain where the void is simply filled by gods and their actions. The rain that falls one day, or the lightning in the sky, these were unknowns to early man, and all attributed to the gods. Volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, and of course great floods.</p>
<p>&#8220;If one was to analyse the human brain in all cultures, there is a propensity to create religion in man. It is most certainly an in built function of the human brain, and analyzing each different culture and religion we see the same spots light up in the brain scans.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even though ancient cultures were divided by oceans and mountains, we see the same patterns in South America as we do in South East Asia, and through to Europe and the Middle East, as well as Australasia. The unknown can only be answered by creating gods, and the unknowns help to deal with the ultimate unknown &#8212; death.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you die, does your soul essence, this electrical mind, the little wisp of light arise from the body or is there full brain death and then just nothing? We will most probably never as a species fully understand that, but in all certainty, one thing is sure in death, and that is the vehicle i.e. the body is vacated and something departs or is merely switched off. Within this universe, nothing can be totally destroyed, if one pours a cup of water onto the floor, the droplets evaporate and eventually come back down to earth again, the same must be said about what inhabits the body of a creature that is alive. That spark, that initial electrical charge, either switches off or is released through some sort of universal memory into the ether.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the earth were to explode today. The universe would still exist as it has done for millennia, there would be little or no change. The universe does not care, it just exists. Man made religions are just questions, they cannot be deemed as fact, they are stories made by humans to react to the utter magnificence of our world and reality, as well as the unknown. Reading any religious book, one must take into account the culture that created that book, the superstitions of the culture, and also the race of the book creators. The linguistic style of the written religious book also gives away many things to the creation time of the piece and the people who created it.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are no prophets today or religious bibles written, because we have science to disprove nonsense, however this same science did not exist in the Middle Ages or prior and generational brainwashing has been allowed to take place. Religions today are basically systems of control that have survived in human culture because they are very effective tools in managing large swathes of people. Religions certainly do not want progress, or lateral thinking or any form of logic, for them this would awaken the masses who are their lifeblood and money supply.&#8221;</p>

<p>Listen here you snivelling wart, Remoaner communist eu-loving scum, before you have a go at Sir Michael Caine, you come over here to the Daily Squib offices and we&#8217;ll put some sense into you idiots.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a Remoaner, you are effectively a traitor to your own country, you support a German led EU Reich, a Marxist EU construct that utilises soviet collectivist techniques to take over sovereign nations and assimilate them into an EU Soviet Union.</p>
<p>If you hate Britain so much go and live in Germany. You Remoaners are pathetic weasels and cowards, you are the lowest form of sub-human detritus, you are lower than dog shit on a shoe.</p>
<p>Do not mess with Michael Caine, one of the coolest gentleman actors that ever lived. We watch Dirty Rotten Scoundrels in the Squib office daily, and we even have our own Ruprecht spot and a cuff handy. Oklahoma, Oklahoma, Oklahoma!</p>
<p>Sir Michael Caine was also great in the new Batman movies, until that Jeremy Irons fella took over. He&#8217;s not as good as Michael, and we suspect is a Remoaner, but that&#8217;s neither here nor there. Where were we? Ah, leave Sir Michael Caine alone.</p>
<p>Remainers are blind to what slavery under the EU means. They are completely clueless to the aspirations for an EU army, or the inhibitive rules and regulations the EU were putting on Britain.</p>
<p>You Remoaner scum would prefer to live in a slave like existence dictated by unelected EU Stasi officials. Are you brainless morons to want such a thing? Are you masochists? We all know you are treasonous traitors who would have collaborated with Germany in WW2, but your stance is ridiculous and is illogical.</p>
<p>Before you have a go at Sir Michael Caine, come to the Squib offices and we&#8217;ll sort you out.</p>

<p>Hell yeah, and not only that, we need Trump to put boots on the ground to clean out Assad once and for all, either to take him to The Hague or string him up from one of his palaces.</p>
<p>Our intelligence sources think that Assad is probably not in Syria, the coward that he is, he is probably holed up in some Eastern European country or deep in Russia somewhere, so this may be a problem.</p>
<p>As for Russia, Putin&#8217;s protests about any U.S. action should be firmly ignored. Putin needs to shut up and take a back seat, his efforts in Syria are pathetic, and his ageing military are defunct next to the American forces that should sweep through like a knife through butter.</p>
<p>Under Obama, there was silence, cowardice and apathy. Under Trump we have war, serious movement towards change and all out conflict.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/24826-trump-needs-his-own-pearl-harbor-911-event-to-unite-country.html" target="_blank">War</a> will be a breath of fresh air from a once stale Obama led spending spree on nothing. Obama in all his years achieved absolutely nothing but spending of U.S. tax dollars on his cronies.</p>
<p>North Korea is the joker in the pack, Trump can take that out in three weeks. Once N. Korea becomes a de facto U.S. military base on the door step of China, the global order will slowly change.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/3089-henry-kissinger-if-you-cant-hear-the-drums-of-war-you-must-be-deaf.html" target="_blank">Russia was allowed to recover from communism</a>, China was allowed to sell their cheap plastic trinkets to the West to increase their military strength. The U.S. needs valid strong enemies, and is prepared to absorb a first strike, but when it comes to war, nothing beats the equipment the U.S. will finally unleash upon their enemies.</p>
<p>With dwindling finite resources on the planet, there can only be one singular global winner&#8230;and it&#8217;s not going to be Russia or China.</p>
<p>The already won race begins in earnest..</p>

<p>What she should have done as soon as she came into office, she has finally done, and wasted countless months on nothing but useless court cases, derailing plots, useless parliamentary votes, and the chance for Scot Sturgeon to regroup and exercise her plans to break-up the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>The fight to free the UK from the totalitarian shackles of the EU are however not over with a simple signing of a piece of paper. There are now more plots to derail the exit process than there were to derail the triggering of Article 50. This impasse, is mainly because Article 50 should have been a Shock and Awe signing quickly after the EU referendum was won.</p>
<p>One thing is certain and that is the UK is not liable for any leaving penalty costs as the EU is stipulating, and it is in fact the EU that owes Britain billions of pounds.</p>
<p>Still governed by thousands of EU laws it will take years to dump the effluent that has crept into the British system so that it can finally govern itself again.</p>
<p>Freedom from slavery and servitude always has a cost, and much like the institutionalised prisoner leaving his cell after forty years in prison, it is going to be hard for the subservient government officials to finally think for themselves without answering to their German and French bosses.</p>
<p>Traitors like Lord Heseltine, Blair, Clegg, Mandelson, Osborne, Cameron, would have happily collaborated with Germany in World War II, and if things had gone their way today would have condemned Britain to become a mere sector in a German-led new EU Reich, a defeat for Britain without a single shot being fired.</p>
<p>The Germans have sought to conquer Britain for many years, through two wars, and through economic/political means through the EU. That third war was fought without guns, but it nevertheless was a war.</p>
<p>Onward, the ship finally sails, the open sea beckons, the horizon is clear. Britain is going global once again…</p>

<p>“Any unpopular leader needs to either harness the uniting power of a national catastrophe or terrorist attack to bolster their power base. This is crucial in also bringing forth further inhibitive laws, because the fearful people and congress will accept anything to keep themselves ‘safe’.</p>
<p>“If it was not for Pearl Harbour, the U.S. would not have joined the war in 1941. If it was not for 911, the U.S. would not have invaded Iraq and Afghanistan, and created many laws inhibiting human freedoms in the country.</p>
<p>“This is why Trump and his team have to engineer an opportunity to profit from an event, or as G.W. Bush did, allow it to occur by telling all the military safeguards to stand down on the day. Maybe another gas attack in Syria where civilians are seen in distress.</p>
<p>“After the event takes place, there will be a huge patriotic response and Trump will be vindicated. The triumphant leader will have his position sealed for the history books.</p>
<p>“War is the medicine for change, as only true change is achieved by the means of extreme violence.”</p>

<p>The more you have the less it means. The discussion ends as soon as the copycatters come onto the scene making any conversation null and void.</p>
<p>The same goes for YouTube videos. There is nothing of value on YouTube today apart from a few instructional functional videos. The conversation is lost amongst a maelstrom of meaningless banal pap, spammers and copycats pathetically begging for subscribers and likes.</p>
<p>The Internet may have been the greatest invention by humans ever created, however it has also been humanity&#8217;s worst enemy, because it has trivialised meaning in everything.</p>
<p>Car crashes come a dime a dozen, women come a dime a dozen, friends come by the million, and your opinion does not count any more. With billions of people vying for attention at the same time, the Internet light, the Internet all seeing eye and Spotlight does not know where to look any more. There is no stasis point, no logical algorithm that can pinpoint the truth any more.</p>
<p>Bertrand Russell once said that in the future the people will be so controlled, so dumbed down that they will be taught that snow is black and will believe it wholeheartedly. We are in that future now, where people have been dumbed down by decades of socialist propaganda, and conditioning, they not only do not know who they are any more but can be told pretty much anything without them questioning.</p>
<p>If the earth were to explode today, the universe would carry on, there would be no change to the functioning of the universal planetary tree. If the Internet were to disappear suddenly today, only a few people would understand why it had to happen. It won&#8217;t though, so you are all safe for now.</p>
<p>There is no meaning to your words any more, and the more you write, the less people care. People cannot be bothered to read or think about big questions, they just want to watch meaningless pap, videos that stimulate their frazzled brains for three seconds before moving on to the next meaningless vapid video clip.</p>
<p>There is no answer as the connections, the dendrites, the axions, the overall technical way you think has been altered permanently by the Internet.</p>
<p>When the microchip implant is introduced, you will already be prepared. Your thought processes and pliable personality, conditioned after many years of Internet usage will accept the chip wholeheartedly.</p>
<p>From there, you will be nothing, your mind will be theirs completely, and from there you will be enslaved for the rest of your meaningless life as much as you are now on the Internet.</p>

<p>Trump has told the IMF to back off from any future Greek rescue, and when the U.S is 16.7% of funds it can do that. Instead, the dollar is going to back the Greeks with some soft loans and a comprehensive rescue deal leaving the euro floundering in the muck.</p>
<p>The news is that Trump is willing to back the Greeks with the dollar until they get their shit ready for a change back to drachma.</p>
<p>In a country where 50% of households do not <a href="http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/766937/Greeks-paying-ZERO-income-tax-amid-financial-crisis">pay income tax</a> even Trump may balk at the severity of the problem.</p>
<p>How many cans have been kicked down the road since the beginning of the Greek crisis, this time however, things are different because the Don is coming to rescue the Greeks from the evil EU, an entity so hated that even leprosy would be preferred than being part of something so insidious.</p>
<p>Leaving the euro in such a manner will effectively castrate the EU, and of course be a mighty FU, for all times sake.</p>
<p>Not only will there be fiscal carnage as EU creditors get fisted, but the political backlash will resonate from the dark dungeons of Brussels to the highest peak of mount Olympus where the jubilant gods reside.</p>
<p>The plans are afoot, and now is the time to solve this problem once and for all, goodbye EU, the die has already been cast.</p>

<p>The House of Lords is currently full of an unelected syphilitic crew of socialist peers who either bought their seats or were instated by the previous Labour government, to this end, there is great uncertainty whether the Article 50 White paper will pass scrutiny from these treacherous traitors lining the seats of the Lords, these slithering snakes in a stinking snake pit of inequity.</p>
<p>The corruption of the Lords is well defined, one can buy a seat quite easily by making the correct donation amount to the party that is in power, and this is why in no uncertain terms the House of Lords as it stands today is unfit for purpose.</p>
<p>As these corrupt individuals take their places every day, they receive £400 just to turn up, not including their massive expense accounts and pensions.</p>
<p>We have the Dark Lord Mandelson hissing in corridors, a bleak leftie figure who plots with great malice on those in the way of the EU. He receives his large stipend from Brussels every month, and delights on spending the money on pink satin sheets and Italian marble floors so he can play with his young boy concubines in one of his many mansions.</p>
<p>Then we have the coal miner fraternity, deep deep Marxists like Lord Arthur Scargill, a denizen of the communist EU, who receives a large pension from Brussels every month amounting to £86,000 per annum. Scargill proclaimed the EU referendum result as: &#8220;won by falsehood&#8221;.</p>
<p>Lord Patten is another one who receives large payments from Brussels, and labelled the Brexit vote as &#8216;xenophobic&#8217;.</p>
<p>As we have thus illustrated, this is only a small picture of what is ahead. The halls of the House of Lords are thick with these parasites, these paid-off buffoons and corrupt scum bags of the lowest order.</p>
<p>There is most certainly no love for the people here, or respect for their wishes to leave the EU, in fact there is only derision and malice for the general population. The majority in the Lords only care for their money, and the prospect of making more money, they do not care one iota for anything else.</p>
<p>Our verdict: If it was up to the Squib we would abolish the House of Lords tomorrow as it serves no purpose apart from entertaining corrupt officials and their agendas, but it is a mainstay of British politics and still survives, alas, since hereditary peers were more or less abolished it has fallen from grace to the point of no return.</p>
<p>If the Lords do not acknowledge the will of the people, and of the House of Commons, needless to say, there may very well be a push to abolish the Lords once and for all. Creating a constitutional crisis, much like occurred in 1911, we could finally see these vagabonds and uncouth putrid oafs thrown to the dogs.</p>

<p>Her &#8216;it-girl&#8217; status was her own undoing, here was this privileged person snorting £400 worth of cocaine up her nostrils daily, indulging in crack and meth, until her septum nasi disappeared, seared by years of ravage to the white stuff. Tara Palmer-Tomkinson fucked like a rabbit and had an insatiable nymphomaniac appetite for debauchery, for this alone she should be inducted into the halls of the ever grinding loins, for it is to the service of Bacchus that she will be remembered.</p>
<p>Obviously Royal connections open doors, and many were opened for this hip gyrating mistress of carnal purgatory, as her chaotic membrane befuddled and torn skimmed through the societal walls much like excrement is pumped through bubbling sewer pipes furnished with well-paid ghost writers.</p>
<p><strong>Hell o</strong></p>
<p>The higher echelons of English society can be as cruel as the lower, and here was this wild eyed maiden on cocaine looking for approval but would never find it. Such is the standoffish harsh nature of the English aristocratic class that parental affection is rarely shown to children leaving them in perpetual limbo for the rest of their sorry loveless lives. Tara was a lost child only looking for some kind of love which she never was to find, looked down upon by the higher ranks as an eccentric curiosity and laughed at by the grimy lower half.</p>
<p>Society should embrace the eccentrics but sadly these days they are scorned more than anything else. The spirit of Dionysian plenty can only follow this misunderstood creature to the depths of depravity and absolution.</p>
<p>And up upon yonder, Tara whooshes into the eternal universal maelstrom, perhaps to be denied entry into the VIP lounge will be the final insult for this tempestuous everlasting misfit.</p>

<p>If you do not pay the TV licence tax from the age of 18 &#8211; 75 you will save £8,000. That saving in itself should be impetus enough to never pay the nefarious BBC taxation.</p>
<p>Many of us grew up with the BBC, however the corporation has changed for the worse in recent years, it now has a very noticeable bias towards the EU, possibly because it receives millions of pounds each year to continue broadcasting pro-EU propaganda. Also, the quality of the programming has deteriorated to such a level that much of it is unwatchable pap.</p>
<p>The only redeeming factor for the BBC recently was the Taboo drama series starring Tom Hardy, but that&#8217;s about it. One can easily watch the odd good BBC program on an internet streaming site where the servers are located somewhere in China. The internet is now full of websites streaming the latest Hollywood films and series all served up from China where there is no such thing as copyright. British ISPs have been ordered to block these sites, however if one is blocked they either change the url or another ten servers pop up in their place.</p>
<p><center><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9PUwBbe4f4k" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center></p>
<p>What does this say about copyright and the rights of the producers of the material being streamed on the internet? Sadly, it&#8217;s a losing battle because in some parts of the globe there is absolutely no respect for copyright resulting in a loss of revenue for film companies and the industry as a whole. Unless China stops what it is doing, nothing will change.</p>
<p>The plus side for all these shenanigans is that you don&#8217;t have to pay £17.80 every time you want to watch the latest film release in the cinema. Just log on to the internets and watch it for free, most of the latest Hollywood offerings of late have been so awful, that when you fast forward the film you will take great pleasure that you saved yourself the cost of going to some overpriced cinema and wasted your well earned money on utter shite.</p>
<p>The same goes for the BBC, by not having a licence you have actually not missed much. There is no point in paying for something as substandard as the BBC is at the moment and the severe left-wing bias that is blatantly shown every day.</p>
<p>Watching an episode of the Grand Tour on Amazon is proof of that very point, where the BBC has failed miserably, Clarkson and those erudite chaps he hangs around with are making a killing elsewhere, leaving the BBC in a total mess, a turgid morose void of blackness has filled the BBC space, and it is getting worse every day, every year.</p>
<p>We need millions more people to join us in this peaceful resistance to a nefarious taxation on the TV. The more of us that hold out, the less funding the BBC will receive. That point alone is a point of victory, so spread the word, the more the better. We must be almost evangelical in our movement to destroy the BBC TV tax that is unjust harassment, corrupt and ultimately criminal in its enactment.</p>
<p><strong>Tips for avoiding the BBC TV Licence Tax</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>As soon as you stop paying the TV licence your address will be marked. The BBC will send threatening harassing letters to you every week. Simply put these in the recycle bin without opening the envelope. The BBC or Capita have no power to do anything to you with their empty threats in their letters.</li>
<li>Never answer the door to a TV inspector, and if you do, never say anything or answer their questions. If you must say something, tell them you remove the Implied Right Of Access to your property. TV inspectors have no powers of arrest or any other power to enter your property. Film them and put them on YouTube.</li>
<li>Best policy is to be TV free, however if you need a big screen for DVDs or games, that&#8217;s okay. It is also all right to watch Netflix or other streaming services on your TV.</li>
</ol>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>The EU already had warning about the profligate Greeks, a country of 11 million people who managed to squander 650 Billion Euros in less than five years. Where that money went is a mystery, but the EU is so entrenched in its failing project that even after the Greek spending spree they kept throwing billions of euros into the Greek black hole as it teetered on the edge of complete bankruptcy.</p>
<p>The Euroexecutives on their unlimited expense accounts are too fearful of rocking the boat, and if the problem of Greece had been dealt with in 2012, and the battered can not kicked down the road further, it wouldn&#8217;t rear its ugly head again and again, much like a Gorgon that refuses to die.</p>
<p>The most potent poison for the EU was always Greece, because it eats away resources that could be utilised better elsewhere. Trying to get the Greeks to not retire at 45 on a full salary pension is a task too great even for the IMF.</p>
<p>In 2012, the Squib wrote about the demise of the EU, and we <a href="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/3166-greece-the-gift-that-keeps-giving.html">prayed</a> they would not throw out Greece, our prayers were answered as the EU scrambled to do anything to keep the most sclerotic country in the union. Even though in 2013 Greek debt was 175.1% of GDP, the EU kept pumping the 4 hour working day Greeks with so much cash they just didn&#8217;t know what to do with it but spend, spend, spend.</p>
<p>There is proof now that Greece is an eternal debt megafuck of ginormous proportions and the socialist structure of the country will always bleed large sums of money, coupled with corrupt ministers and businesses, there is no hope for Greece apart from maybe an implosion, exit from EU and a return to the drachma. We don&#8217;t want that though, we want Juncker to fawn over Tsipras or which ever useless leader they have. We want the EU to do everything it can possibly do to keep the Greek thorn in its side. To bleed the EU constantly until there is nothing left but a corpse, suppurating in the corner. If Greece leaves, the EU will have a chance of survival, this should never happen, may the corrupt profligate lazy parasitical Greeks smash the EU once and for all, saving Europe from the calamity of a German led Soviet bloc that is becoming increasingly authoritarian and is in effect a totalitarian collectivist Soviet construct.</p>

<p>Let us read from the official website www.parliament.uk where it <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/business/commons/the-speaker/the-role-of-the-speaker/role-of-the-speaker/">states</a> quite clearly:</p>
<h2 style="padding-left: 60px;"><em>Politically impartial</em></h2>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em>Speakers must be politically impartial. Therefore, on election the new Speaker must resign from their political party and remain separate from political issues even in retirement. However, the Speaker will deal with their constituents&#8217; problems like a normal MP.</em></p>
<p>And from here, let us go to the current House Speaker, John Bercow&#8217;s little <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/donald-trump-uk-state-visit-speaker-address-parliament-a7565651.html">tirade</a> against the newly elected president of the United States, Donald J. Trump.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em>“Before the imposition of the migrant ban I would myself have been strongly opposed to an address by President Trump in Westminster Hall,&#8221; Mr Bercow told MPs.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em>“After the imposition of the migrant ban by President Trump I am even more strongly opposed to an address by President Trump in Westminster Hall.”</em></p>
<p>Parliamentary insiders have revealed some wonderful news, that this impartial imposition on Britain&#8217;s greatest ally could mean the end of Bercow as House Speaker. Rumours have it that his extreme left wing whore wife is the author of this mess, and has pushed her &#8216;impartial&#8217; husband to deny Trump his day in parliament. If this is the case, the House Speaker has crossed a line from which he cannot recover.</p>
<p>Bercow, has of course many enemies in the Commons, particularly within the Tories, and they are now waiting for the moment to stick their daggers into Bercow&#8217;s back and finish him once and for all.</p>

<p>Whilst pretending to care about talking to African kids on a football pitch in the Sudan, or whatever other place the photoshoot was set up, Beckham only had one thing on his mind &#8212; <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/02/06/revealed-hackers-tried-blackmail-david-beckham-1m-avoid-embarrassing/">a Knighthood from the Queen</a>.</p>
<p>This despicable poseur and illiterate boy-voiced babbler from Chingford is a prime example of what is wrong with celebrity culture, an insipid pit of detritus that sometimes reveals everything it is made up of to the public.</p>
<p>Yes, sure, hackers are not the cream of the crop too, but in this case they have come on top. By revealing Beckham to be what he really is, light has finally broken through the darkness of secrecy and lies portrayed by egotistical rats like Beckham, a shameful disgrace to humanity and &#8216;charity&#8217;.</p>
<p>In one message the 41-year-old former England captain branded the Honours Committee &#8220;unappreciative cunts&#8221; after missing out on a knighthood in 2013 and dismissed lesser awards, ranting: &#8220;Unless it&#8217;s a knighthood fuck off&#8221;.</p>
<p>David Beckham, you are a despicable, useless excuse for a human being and you do not deserve even one crumb of mercy for your lies. Let us hope this is remembered to your last days and you are struck off from UNICEF you foul cunt.</p>

<p>Throughout history, Christians have created more death and mayhem than any other recorded religion in the history of mankind.</p>
<p>From Hitler&#8217;s Christian troops who believed they were upholding god&#8217;s word by killing Jews, to the Japan atomic bomb detonations to the Spanish Inquisition and to the missionaries in South America who committed atrocities on the indigenous population in the name of Jesus, there is enough evidence out there proving how evil Christianity is. Lest we forget the smiling Catholic priests of Europe who in world war II eagerly revealed where the Jews were and waved them away as they were ferried to the concentration camps to die.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-21774 size-full" src="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Clergy-Nazi-Officials-apr-16-e1486399337196.jpeg" alt="Clergy-Nazi-Officials-apr-16" width="640" height="436" /></p>
<p>To have something masked in goodness and love, yet to commit unspeakable acts of cruelty on people describes the Christian faith very succinctly. This malevolent religion masks itself in outward displays of goodness, charity and love yet behind doors priests commit unspeakable evil acts of buggery on children in the name of Jesus Christ. The Holy Christian church is an evil organisation, almost demonic in its acts of cruelty to children with the proliferation of paedophile priests fucking little boys in the vestry whilst only a few feet away someone innocently utters the lord&#8217;s prayer.</p>
<p>Christianity should most definitely be banned from any nation, as the atrocities created in its name are too long to even list. George W. Bush himself an evangelical Christian, along with Tony Blair a devout Catholic know all too well of what they did in Iraq in the name of Jesus Christ. They murdered and butchered over 1.6 million Muslims and displaced millions more from their homeland. All in the name of their god of course, and who is to say they were not justified in their actions, especially when they had the full support of the churches during the invasion and occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-21775 size-full" src="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/us-brutality-iraq-e1486400122645.jpeg" alt="us brutality iraq" width="640" height="420" /></p>
<p>The demonic entity of the Catholic church itself, the Holy See is one of the richest most affluent organisations in the world. How they have amassed such large amounts of money is of course a trick of the devil himself, for he masks his technique well whilst plundering and enriching in the name of of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Here is a small list of Christian atrocities committed throughout history. By all means cross reference the list yourself, do your own research:</p>
<h1><span style="color: #ff0000;">Deaths Caused by Christianity</span></h1>
<h3 align="justify">Ancient Pagans</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<div align="justify">As soon as Christianity was legal (315), more and more pagan temples were destroyed by Christian mobs. Pagan priests were killed in their thousands.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">Between 315 and 6th century thousands of pagan believers were slain.</div>

</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">16th and 17th century Ireland. English troops “pacified and civilized” Ireland, where only Gaelic “wild Irish”, “unreasonable beasts lived without any knowledge of God or good manners, in common of their goods, cattle, women, children and every other thing.” One of the more successful soldiers, a certain Humphrey Gilbert, half-brother of Sir Walter Raleigh, ordered that “the heddes of all those (of what sort soever thei were) which were killed in the daie, should be cutte off from their bodies… and should bee laied on the ground by eche side of the waie”, which effort to civilize the Irish indeed caused “greate terrour to the people when thei sawe the heddes of their dedde fathers, brothers, children, kinsfolke, and freinds on the grounde”.<br />
Tens of thousands of Gaelic Irish fell victim to the carnage. [SH99, 225]</div>

</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">The Archbishop of Tyre, eye-witness, wrote: “It was impossible to look upon the vast numbers of the slain without horror; everywhere lay fragments of human bodies, and the very ground was covered with the blood of the slain. It was not alone the spectacle of headless bodies and mutilated limbs strewn in all directions that roused the horror of all who looked upon them. Still more dreadful was it to gaze upon the victors themselves, dripping with blood from head to foot, an ominous sight which brought terror to all who met them. It is reported that within the Temple enclosure alone about ten thousand infidels perished.” [TG79]</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">Christian chronicler Eckehard of Aura noted that “even the following summer in all of Palestine the air was polluted by the stench of decomposition”. One million victims of the first crusade alone. [WW41]</div>

</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">Albigensians: the first Crusade intended to slay other Christians. [DO29]<br />

While Columbus described the Indians as “idolators” and “slaves, as many as [the Crown] shall order,” his pal Michele de Cuneo, Italian nobleman, referred to the natives as “beasts” because “they eat when they are hungry,” and made love “openly whenever they feel like it.” [SH204-205]</div>

<div align="justify">Likewise in the words of John Winthrop, first governor of Massachusetts Bay Colony: “justifieinge the undertakeres of the intended Plantation in New England … to carry the Gospell into those parts of the world, … and to raise a Bulworke against the kingdome of the Ante-Christ.” [SH235]</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">In average two thirds of the native population were killed by colonist-imported smallpox before violence began. This was a great sign of “the marvelous goodness and providence of God” to the Christians of course, e.g. the Governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony wrote in 1634, as “for the natives, they are near all dead of the smallpox, so as the Lord hath cleared our title to what we possess.” [SH109,238]</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">On Hispaniola alone, on Columbus visits, the native population (Arawak), a rather harmless and happy people living on an island of abundant natural resources, a literal paradise, soon mourned 50,000 dead. [SH204]</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">The surviving Indians fell victim to rape, murder, enslavement and Spanish raids.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">As one of the culprits wrote: “So many Indians died that they could not be counted, all through the land the Indians lay dead everywhere. The stench was very great and pestiferous.” [SH69]</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">The Indian chief Hatuey fled with his people but was captured and burned alive. As “they were tying him to the stake a Franciscan friar urged him to take Jesus to his heart so that his soul might go to heaven, rather than descend into hell. Hatuey replied that if heaven was where the Christians went, he would rather go to hell.” [SH70]</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">What happened to his people was described by an eyewitness:<br />
“The Spaniards found pleasure in inventing all kinds of odd cruelties … They built a long gibbet, long enough for the toes to touch the ground to prevent strangling, and hanged thirteen [natives] at a time in honour of Christ Our Saviour and the twelve Apostles… then, straw was wrapped around their torn bodies and they were burned alive.” [SH72]<br />
Or, on another occasion:<br />
“The Spaniards cut off the arm of one, the leg or hip of another, and from some their heads at one stroke, like butchers cutting up beef and mutton for market. Six hundred, including the Cacique, were thus slain like brute beasts…Vasco [de Balboa] ordered forty of them to be torn to pieces by dogs.” [SH83]</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">The “island’s population of about eight million people at the time of Columbus’s arrival in 1492 already had declined by a third to a half before the year 1496 was out.” Eventually all the island’s natives were exterminated, so the Spaniards were “forced” to import slaves from other Caribbean islands, who soon suffered the same fate. Thus “the Caribbean’s millions of native people [were] thereby effectively liquidated in barely a quarter of a century”. [SH72-73] “In less than the normal lifetime of a single human being, an entire culture of millions of people, thousands of years resident in their homeland, had been exterminated.” [SH75]</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">“And then the Spanish turned their attention to the mainland of Mexico and Central America. The slaughter had barely begun. The exquisite city of Tenochtitln [Mexico city] was next.” [SH75]</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">Cortez, Pizarro, De Soto and hundreds of other Spanish conquistadors likewise sacked southern and Mesoamerican civilizations in the name of Christ (De Soto also sacked Florida).</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">“When the 16th century ended, some 200,000 Spaniards had moved to the Americas. By that time probably more than 60,000,000 natives were dead.” [SH95]</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p align="justify">Of course no different were the founders of what today is the US of A.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div align="justify">Although none of the settlers would have survived winter without native help, they soon set out to expel and exterminate the Indians. Warfare among (north American) Indians was rather harmless, in comparison to European standards, and was meant to avenge insults rather than conquer land. In the words of some of the pilgrim fathers: “Their Warres are farre less bloudy…”, so that there usually was “no great slawter of nether side”. Indeed, “they might fight seven yeares and not kill seven men.” What is more, the Indians usually spared women and children. [SH111]</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">In the spring of 1612 some English colonists found life among the (generally friendly and generous) natives attractive enough to leave Jamestown – “being idell … did runne away unto the Indyans,” – to live among them.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">“Governor Thomas Dale had them hunted down and executed: ‘Some he apointed (sic) to be hanged Some burned Some to be broken upon wheles, others to be staked and some shott to deathe’.” [SH105] Of course these elegant measures were restricted for fellow Englishmen: “This was the treatment for those who wished to act like Indians. For those who had no choice in the matter, because they were the native people of Virginia” methods were different: “when an Indian was accused by an Englishman of stealing a cup and failing to return it, the English response was to attack the natives in force, burning the entire community” down. [SH105]</div>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<div align="justify">On the territory that is now Massachusetts the founding fathers of the colonies were committing genocide, in what has become known as the “Peqout War”. The killers were New England Puritan Christians, refugees from persecution in their own home country England.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">When however, a dead colonist was found, apparently killed by Narragansett Indians, the Puritan colonists wanted revenge. Despite the Indian chief’s pledge they attacked.<br />
Somehow they seem to have lost the idea of what they were after, because when they were greeted by Pequot Indians (long-time foes of the Narragansetts) the troops nevertheless made war on the Pequots and burned their villages.<br />
The puritan commander-in-charge John Mason after one massacre wrote: “And indeed such a dreadful Terror did the Almighty let fall upon their Spirits, that they would fly from us and run into the very Flames, where many of them perished … God was above them, who laughed his Enemies and the Enemies of his People to Scorn, making them as a fiery Oven … Thus did the Lord judge among the Heathen, filling the Place with dead Bodies”: men, women, children. [SH113-114]</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">So “the Lord was pleased to smite our Enemies in the hinder Parts, and to give us their land for an inheritance”. [SH111].</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">Because of his readers’ assumed knowledge of Deuteronomy, there was no need for Mason to quote the words that immediately follow:<br />
“Thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth. But thou shalt utterly destroy them…” (Deut 20)</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">Mason’s comrade Underhill recalled how “great and doleful was the bloody sight to the view of the young soldiers” yet reassured his readers that “sometimes the Scripture declareth women and children must perish with their parents”. [SH114]</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">Other Indians were killed in successful plots of poisoning. The colonists even had dogs especially trained to kill Indians and to devour children from their mothers breasts, in the colonists’ own words: “blood Hounds to draw after them, and Mastives to seaze them.” (This was inspired by Spanish methods of the time)<br />
In this way they continued until the extermination of the Pequots was near. [SH107-119]</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">The surviving handful of Indians “were parceled out to live in servitude. John Endicott and his pastor wrote to the governor asking for ‘a share’ of the captives, specifically ‘a young woman or girle and a boy if you thinke good’.” [SH115]</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">Other tribes were to follow the same path.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">Comment the Christian exterminators: “God’s Will, which will at last give us cause to say: How Great is His Goodness! and How Great is his Beauty!”<br />
“Thus doth the Lord Jesus make them to bow before him, and to lick the Dust!” [TA]</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">Like today, lying was OK to Christians then. “Peace treaties were signed with every intention to violate them: when the Indians ‘grow secure uppon (sic) the treatie’, advised the Council of State in Virginia, ‘we shall have the better Advantage both to surprise them, &amp; cutt downe theire Corne’.” [SH106]</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">In 1624 sixty heavily armed Englishmen cut down 800 defenceless Indian men, women and children. [SH107]</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">In a single massacre in “King Philip’s War” of 1675 and 1676 some “600 Indians were destroyed. A delighted Cotton Mather, revered pastor of the Second Church in Boston, later referred to the slaughter as a ‘barbeque’.” [SH115]</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">To summarize: Before the arrival of the English, the western Abenaki people in New Hampshire and Vermont had numbered 12,000. Less than half a century later about 250 remained alive – a destruction rate of 98%. The Pocumtuck people had numbered more than 18,000, fifty years later they were down to 920 – 95% destroyed. The Quiripi-Unquachog people had numbered about 30,000, fifty years later they were down to 1500 – 95% destroyed. The Massachusetts people had numbered at least 44,000, fifty years later barely 6000 were alive – 81% destroyed. [SH118] These are only a few examples of the multitude of tribes living before Christian colonists set their foot on the New World. All this was before the smallpox epidemics of 1677 and 1678 had occurred. And the carnage was not over then.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">All the above was only the beginning of the European colonization, it was before the frontier age actually had begun.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">A total of maybe more than 150 million Indians (of both Americas) were destroyed in the period of 1500 to 1900, as an average two thirds by smallpox and other epidemics, that leaves some 50 million killed directly by violence, bad treatment and slavery.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">In many countries, such as Brazil, and Guatemala, this continues even today.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 align="justify">More Glorious events in US history</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<div align="justify">Reverend Solomon Stoddard, one of New England’s most esteemed religious leaders, in “1703 formally proposed to the Massachusetts Governor that the colonists be given the financial wherewithal to purchase and train large packs of dogs ‘to hunt Indians as they do bears’.” [SH241]</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="justify"><a href="http://www.legendsofamerica.com/na-sandcreek.html" target="_blank">Massacre of Sand Creek</a>, Colorado 11/29/1864. Colonel John Chivington, a former Methodist minister and still elder in the church (“I long to be wading in gore”) had a Cheyenne village of about 600, mostly women and children, gunned down despite the chiefs’ waving with a white flag: 400-500 killed.<br />
From an eye-witness account: “There were some thirty or forty squaws collected in a hole for protection; they sent out a little girl about six years old with a white flag on a stick; she had not proceeded but a few steps when she was shot and killed. All the squaws in that hole were afterwards killed …” [SH131]</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">By the 1860s, “in Hawaii the Reverend Rufus Anderson surveyed the carnage that by then had reduced those islands’ native population by 90 percent or more, and he declined to see it as tragedy; the expected total die-off of the Hawaiian population was only natural, this missionary said, somewhat equivalent to ‘the amputation of diseased members of the body’.” [SH244]</div>

<h3 align="justify"> 20th Century Church Atrocities</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<div align="justify"><b>Catholic extermination camps</b><br />
Surprisingly few know that Nazi extermination camps in World War II were by no means the only ones in Europe at the time. In the years 1942-1943 also in Croatia existed numerous extermination camps, run by Catholic Ustasha under their dictator Ante Paveli, a practising Catholic and regular visitor to the then pope. There were even concentration camps exclusively for children!In these camps – the most notorious was Jasenovac, headed by a Franciscan friar – orthodox-Christian Serbians (and a substantial number of Jews) were murdered. Like the Nazis the Catholic Ustasha burned their victims in kilns, alive (the Nazis were decent enough to have their victims gassed first). But most of the victims were simply stabbed, slain or shot to death, the number of them being estimated between 300,000 and 600,000, in a rather tiny country. Many of the killers were Franciscan friars. The atrocities were appalling enough to induce bystanders of the Nazi “Sicherheitsdient der SS”, watching, to complain about them to Hitler (who did not listen). The pope knew about these events and did nothing to prevent them. [MV]</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="justify"><b>Catholic terror in Vietnam</b><br />
In 1954 Vietnamese freedom fighters – the Viet Minh – had finally defeated the French colonial government in North Vietnam, which by then had been supported by U.S. funds amounting to more than $2 billion. Although the victorious assured religious freedom to all (most non-Buddhist Vietnamese were Catholics), due to huge anticommunist propaganda campaigns many Catholics fled to the South. With the help of Catholic lobbies in Washington and Cardinal Spellman, the Vatican’s spokesman in U.S. politics, who later on would call the U.S. forces in Vietnam “Soldiers of Christ”, a scheme was concocted to prevent democratic elections which could have brought the communist Viet Minh to power in the South as well, and the fanatic Catholic Ngo Dinh Diem was made president of South Vietnam. [MW16ff]Diem saw to it that U.S. aid, food, technical and general assistance was given to Catholics alone, Buddhist individuals and villages were ignored or had to pay for the food aids which were given to Catholics for free. The only religious denomination to be supported was Roman Catholicism.The Vietnamese McCarthyism turned even more vicious than its American counterpart. By 1956 Diem promulgated a presidential order which read:</div>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
<div align="justify">“Individuals considered dangerous to the national defence and common security may be confined by executive order, to a <b>concentration camp.</b>“</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote dir="ltr">
<p align="justify">Supposedly to fight communism, thousands of Buddhist protesters and monks were imprisoned in “detention camps.” Out of protest dozens of Buddhist teachers – male and female – and monks poured gasoline over themselves and burned themselves. (<i>Note that Buddhists burned themselves: in comparison Christians tend to burn others</i>). Meanwhile some of the prison camps, which in the meantime were filled with Protestant and even Catholic protesters as well, had turned into no-nonsense death camps. It is estimated that during this period of terror (1955-1960) at least 24,000 were wounded – mostly in street riots – 80,000 people were executed, 275,000 had been detained or tortured, and about 500,000 were sent to concentration or detention camps. [MW76-89].</p>
<p>To support this kind of government in the next decade thousands of American GIs lost their life….</p></blockquote>
<ul dir="ltr">
<li>
<div align="justify"><b>Rwanda Massacres</b><br />
In 1994 in the small African country of Rwanda in just a few months several hundred thousand civilians were butchered, apparently a conflict of the Hutu and Tutsi ethnic groups.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote dir="ltr">
<p align="justify">For quite some time there were only rumours about Catholic clergy actively involved in the 1994 Rwanda massacres. Odd denials of involvement were printed in Catholic church journals, before even anybody had openly accused members of the church.</p>
<p align="justify">Then, 10/10/96, in the newscast of S2 Aktuell, Germany – a station not at all critical to Christianity – the following was stated:</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr">
<p align="justify">“Anglican as well as Catholic priests and nuns are suspect of having actively participated in murders. Especially the conduct of a certain Catholic priest has been occupying the public mind in Rwanda’s capital Kigali for months. He was minister of the church of the Holy Family and allegedly murdered Tutsis in the most brutal manner. He is reported to have accompanied marauding Hutu militia with a gun in his cowl. In fact there has been a bloody slaughter of Tutsis seeking shelter in his parish. Even two years after the massacres many Catholics refuse to set foot on the threshold of their church, because to them the participation of a certain part of the clergy in the slaughter is well established. There is almost no church in Rwanda that has not seen refugees – women, children, old – being brutally butchered facing the crucifix.</p>
<p>According to eyewitnesses clergymen gave away hiding Tutsis and turned them over to the machetes of the Hutu militia.</p>
<p align="justify">In connection with these events again and again two Benedictine nuns are mentioned, both of whom have fled into a Belgian monastery in the meantime to avoid prosecution. According to survivors one of them called the Hutu killers and led them to several thousand people who had sought shelter in her monastery. By force the doomed were driven out of the churchyard and were murdered in the presence of the nun right in front of the gate. The other one is also reported to have directly cooperated with the murderers of the Hutu militia. In her case again witnesses report that she watched the slaughtering of people in cold blood and without showing response. She is even accused of having procured some petrol used by the killers to set on fire and burn their victims alive…” [S2]</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Iraq/Afghanistan War</strong></p>
<p align="justify">Over 2 million Muslims lost their lives after George W. Bush and Britain’s Tony Blair invaded Iraq and Afghanistan in 2003. The resultant vacuum created by the toppling of Saddam Hussein was filled by ISIS who now occupy half of Syria and Iraq, an area as large as the country of Belgium.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are programmed from youth to be a tax slave, a worker drone. You then leave school and implement the programming by working for most of the year to pay tax to the state. Once you retire you are still taxed on your pension and you still have to pay council tax. Then you die. In effect, your whole life is pointless and serves only one singular purpose, to pay tax. Of course, there is an added bonus, you can give birth to another tax slave or however many you want. They too will go through the same process and live pointless lives as tax slaves.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man then sat back in his chair, looked up at the ceiling, then continued.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel that the state should honour each tax slave and give them a tax medal at the end of their life. This would be an affirmation of tax slavery that has been fruitful and give tax slaves a purpose in their imprisonment from birth to death.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a tax slave you work and die on the job, you are servicing the coffers of the state, you are servicing the wars, the unlimited expense accounts of ministers and the duck houses, the royal family and many other things, I could go on and on, but I feel you would lose track of what I am trying to say.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tax slaves have limited times with their families and friends, they do not really get to know their children, and they rarely get to know their true selves. They have no time for true moments, for creation, for cogitation and for realising the true meaning of existence and life. They are mere drones, working, commuting, and living useless fruitless lives to fulfil their tax payments to the almighty state. To live and die a tax slave is a waste of life, a terrible waste of humanity and a horrible meaningless nihilistic existence.</p>
<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z1qC78MLqhU" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center>&#8220;If you are a tax slave and reading this, look at your sorry life for one second. You are a slave, you commute every day at your own expense and spend many hours on trains or in traffic jams. Add those minutes and hours wasted into years and those wasted hours at work where you are degraded every day so that you can pay tax. You are not living a life, you are a living corpse, doing the same thing day in day out, in the system of tax payment until you die.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sadly tax slaves will never be honoured. Why honour mindless drones completing their tax paying tasks day in day out willingly and without question? It might ruin their programming. We can&#8217;t have that sort of thing happening. Just continue what you are doing, day in day out until your heart finally stops and it&#8217;s all over for your meaningless sordid useless life.</p>
<p>The man who produces while others dispose of his product is a slave.</p>

<p>Donald Trump&#8217;s Great Wall will have an added bonus for guards manning the towers.</p>
<p>Anyone within a hundred metres from the wall will get shot, and the shooter gets $20 per Hispanic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Border guards can supplement their salary by shooting as many as they want daily. Like shoot twenty a day and we give you $400. Now that&#8217;s a good incentive right there, on top of your regular pay check. Keep going and by the end of the year you can buy a Porsche with the money. I want to insentivize staff, bring in some entrepreneurial spirit to keeping these criminals out of our country.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>We got the bullets just keep firing</strong></p>
<p>The new bonus scheme is going well, already thousands of Mexicans have been stopped from crossing the porous borders, and with the upcoming deportations which will take place in many cities, soon the U.S. should be Mexican free.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the rate we&#8217;re getting rid of Mexicans you won&#8217;t be able to buy a burrito in California. I mean can you imagine that? Already, 98% of Los Angeles has disappeared. Here in San Diego nearly 99% is gone. The other day I was walking down the street and did not see one Hispanic. Not one. Before Trump, you didn&#8217;t see anyone but Hispanics,&#8221; Earl Trout, 48, a car salesman from Encinetas told LA Week.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s what is good about the Donald, he knows what&#8217;s good, and he moves on that like before anyone thinks about moving on it, he&#8217;s an opportunities guy, a doer, and this is what the U.S. and U.K. needs right now.</p>
<p>Already in his first five days in office, the Don has repealed Obamacare, started building a wall, and fired half of the State department who were linked to Hillary. That&#8217;s no mean feat for a fat guy pushing his seventies.</p>
<p>So, what happens when Theresa May, the British PM comes along to meet the Don?</p>
<p>First off, the internal memos have to spell her name correctly, that took about three goes, then the Don has to figure out how he&#8217;s going to speak to this stuck up British slut, because she&#8217;s making all the right noises on Brexit but barely delivering.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dames come a dime a dozen, you just got to know how to treat the ones who have power. This May broad, I can&#8217;t just grab her, for a start, she&#8217;s British, they don&#8217;t like that kinda thing. So, I gotta shake her hand and smile at her, make it business, that&#8217;s what my adviser says.</p>
<p>&#8220;No pussy jokes. She&#8217;s got a fierce British face with a pointed beak that could poke yer eye out. Nah, I&#8217;m not gonna try and fuck her, although screwing the Limeys on some trade deals would be good, I think I&#8217;ll treat &#8217;em fair as long as they play on my terms.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. May seen coming off the plane certainly looked prime ministerial, there&#8217;s something about coming to the land of the free, where no one knows how to make a cuppa, and the wide grid like streets make everything look the same. Compared to tiny old Blighty, America is massive. No doubt, Theresa will be anxious to get to work immediately, and in her newly birthed socialistic tone, she will quietly denounce torture, and commandeer the chauvinistic pig that is the Trump from any manhandling.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall tell him to put it away. If he takes it out, or tries to grab a handful, I shall politely remove his hand from my nether regions and change the subject to Russian relations or EU matters,&#8221; May politely reveals once touching down.</p>
<p>As the news will no doubt filter out later on in the day, everything will go swimmingly and there will be a new special relationship birthed. The return of Churchill&#8217;s bust to the White House, was the beginning of the relationship, after eight long years of horrid anti-British Obama rule.</p>
<p>Yes, it will be like Maggie and Reagan all over again. Trump and May, will frolic in the aisles as they seal the fate of the evil EU once and for all.</p>

<p>&#8220;You get £300 just to turn up at the House of Lords, and naturally the boys down there need somewhere to spend their pennies and pounds.  I acquired quite a few clandestine numbers I tell you. A good whipping is what is needed for some of my Labour ministers, put them in line, for that Article 50 white paper,&#8221; Corbyn told the BBC from his chamber.</p>
<p>After the vote is cast for the umpteenth time in the Commons, it will be moved to the lion&#8217;s den of Remoaners, the House of Lords. By our count, for every Brexiteer there are thirty socialist commie Lords and Baronesses who are in tow with Brussels through dodgy corrupt monetary means.</p>
<p>Our political commentator, Pascal Mount, was in the House of Lords yesterday gauging the sentiment on the upcoming Article 50 vote.</p>
<p>&#8220;I sat in the pit and shouted out loud &#8216;Brexit For Britain&#8217; and was immediately accosted by a 94-year-old Europhile Baroness who dangled her false teeth over my head. Her heady breath smelled of rotten silage from the farm, her dandruff as thick as the Minnesota snow befuddled my already panicked sensibilities. When a long gelatinous lurgy spindled down from her nose into my mouth I wretched wildly, vomit coming up in spurts, as I could not hold it any more, I projectile vomited my tuna and sweetcorn sandwich onto her white wig.&#8221;</p>
<p>No doubt, there will be some friction in the House of Lords, against the will of the people.</p>

<p>At about 12.00 EST Madonna was spied skulking around Pennsylvania Avenue with what appeared to be some ominous sticks of dynamite.</p>
<p>Agent 9, Secret Service, revealed the full story to waiting news reporters: &#8220;We saw Madonna walking up and down the street. I signalled to my fellow agents and spoke in my earpiece, you know like we do all the time. She saw me, then tried to act normal even though she had three sticks of dynamite in her hand. I caught up with her and told her in no uncertain terms to take that dynamite and get the hell away from the White House. Madonna, looked me up and down, grabbed her crotch, then skipped away singing &#8216;La Isla Bonita&#8217;. Thanks to the secret service another tragedy was averted. We deserve a medal or something for our bravery.&#8221;</p>
<p>Madonna, who is said to have thought about &#8216;blowing up the White House&#8217; is said to be distraught after Donald J. Trump became president of the United States of America.</p>

<p>Before the EU Referendum, both parliament and politicians vowed the referendum was the final word of the people and the result would be honoured. This is probably because they never thought that Brexit would be the answer. Only when the answer was not what they wanted to hear did they go back on their word.</p>
<p>To socialists and leftists, there is no such thing as a democracy, and we have seen that with the treacherous court case brought by the infantile Gina Miller and her sewage politics of corrupt money.</p>
<p>By paying off eurocentric judges bags of money this is not democracy. This is law committed by treachery, dishonesty and corruption.</p>
<p>Where a legitimate EU referendum can be overturned by unelected judges who are clearly under the control of Brussels, is a nail in the coffin of justice, and legal authority. Their judgement does not mean anything apart from proclaiming the British judicial system a tool for rich people to buy.</p>
<p>With this nail in British justice&#8217;s coffin comes the crown of excrement, freshly laid on Gina Miller&#8217;s head for all to see. Let her wear her crown till her dying day, let her every day smell the putrid rotting shit on her head, her crown of glorious corruption, of defilement of British democracy, of thwarting the will of millions of British citizens and for those who fought and died in World War II for our freedom.</p>
<p>May the millions who died in WW2 shout in your ears for the rest of your sorry life, Gina Miller, you and your treasonous scum friends who made every effort to commit treason and succeed in your ardent fervour.</p>
<p>You will wear the turd crown on your head forever. We understand Ms. Miller is under armed guard 24 hours a day and cannot go outside. Maybe you should go back to Guyana where you can at least walk about unhindered, as you cannot do the same in Britain as you are hated so much.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The insane brainwashed Christian evangelists came up to the podium one by one to dole out their religious nonsense, and this signalled the turning point in America&#8217;s direction.</p>
<p>The US will now revert back to the heady days of George W. Bush post 911, and a full frontal assault on the whole of the Islamic religion.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s nothing wrong with that, many will say, however, this stance always fails because by further attacking Islam, one only fuels more terror, and recruitment into the fighting, defensive stance of their religion, many who were previously peaceful will join the fight against what they see as an unjust attack on their religion and lands.</p>
<p>Under a Trump presidency, we will thus see a noticeable escalation of numbers of jihadists created, more terrorism and more ISIS territory gained.</p>
<p>We will also see increased hatred of Islam within Europe and the United States, where citizens who overtly dress like Muslims will be attacked in the streets and told to leave.</p>
<p>Trump has already talked about blocking Muslims travelling to the US, however he has not stopped there, he has also alluded to detaining Muslims in camps, away from the general populace. These camps are already being prepared, as they were previously FEMA camps, and the lists of known Muslims within the US have already been drawn up. Those who are armed will be rounded up first.</p>
<p>The use of religion to create war is an old technique utilised by many throughout history, and Trump, with the Christian evangelists in tow is now on a mission from his god to decimate the Middle East further, of course with the full support of Israel.</p>
<p>This is all a consequence of pulling the rubber band too far during eight years of Obama rule. At some point the rubber band snaps back to its original state, the state of deranged Christians and their false religion of peace. The state of the true white America.</p>

<p>Here lies a travesty of lies deep within its core, a standing joke upon its own self, the walls will crumble, decaying furiously, rotting away, led by the ludicrous, the depraved, and the lazy. To achieve greatness a civilisation must transcend its intrinsic evolution towards moral decay and this is why America fails miserably time after time. Any civilisation that revels in illusion so voraciously is always doomed to eventual failure.</p>
<p>Looking inward will not save America but speed up its decline. Under Trump there will be no greatness, for he does not hold greatness within his own being, only moral degeneration and terminal egoistic sickness fuelled by incessant greed. There is a morbid death in Donald Trump, and once he acquires the previously unattainable he loses interest, this new play toy, this new building, this new woman. Trump will fuck America, like he fucks everything else, then discard it.</p>
<p>The narcissist believes in his greatness and everything he touches turns to be great, but this is a false belief only fuelled by the narcissist&#8217;s immense unqualified undeserving ego and the mirror he looks in every day.</p>
<p>Trump much like Obama will bring further ruin to America and the unfortunate spillage will consume the globe, for there is no greatness in an empire that only values material conquest, there is no value in chaos and destruction meted upon a system which undermines any logical civil conclusion or intellectual spiritual path .</p>
<p>Much like Obama who preyed on &#8216;Hope&#8217; and &#8216;Change&#8217;, Trump preys on blind nationalism, on Aryan supremacy, on greed, the pestilence of war, and more greed. There is no &#8216;Great&#8217; within these limited bounds, only dispersion and humiliation.</p>
<p>The future for America lies in destruction, in terminal decline, for every empire has had to forfeit its position, and the United States is cursed to die young. These Americans have not known or even bothered to look at cultures or civilisations that lasted for thousands of years, they have simply crushed them under rubble from their bombs and drones. Where Obama stood by, Trump will act, however both stances can only bring destruction in the end, because there is no solid ground to stand on. The US is a neural network of virulent predatory violence stood on a bedrock of supreme corruption and festering greed.</p>
<p>America has moved too fast, and any civilisation that moves with such speed, such naivety and disrespect for the countless that superseded them is doomed to failure. In 240 years it has chosen to leap, but it has not looked at where it is to fall, and falling it is, fast, with no mercy or abatement.</p>
<p>There is no greatness in proclaiming greatness, or trying to regain greatness, for you do not know what the word means. The beginning of the journey or path to greatness is not even acknowledging the word or even trying to emulate the tenets  of accomplishments which only others can give to you, not yourself, or some pumped up meat packing bully like Donald Trump can evangelize.</p>
<p>No. There will never be a Great America. Too much has passed under the river now for America, the day has passed, the sun is setting on a nation that will never be great but is doomed to ultimate failure and destruction.</p>

<p>I can feel the light coming through the clouds. I can see the clouds slowly parting as the sun shines over the gulag that is the internet today after eight fucking horrible years of Obama anti-free speech sovietization.</p>
<p>I look up to the heavens and say what I want to say without having all my backlinks erased because of a story I wrote, or some omnipotent internet authority threatening me with complete erasure for not complying with the Obama anti-free speech doctrine.</p>
<p>As the sunshine comes over the landscape the politically correct pieces of shit all look up and scream, their skin turns to dust as what remains of them are blown in the wind back down the drains where they came from. The Social Justice Warriors, an element of soviet conditioning try to run back into the darkness but are caught out by the the bright rays. They explode magnificently, blood, guts and their horrid authoritarian ideology disappear into the mire never to be seen again.</p>
<p>I look up and breathe a deep sigh of relief, my lungs take in pure air, not the putrid soviet Marxist polluted air of Obama&#8217;s propaganda and his spendthrift waste.</p>
<p>There is purity again, a cleansing of socialist detritus, the mainstream Obama press, once omnipotent, now impotent.</p>
<p>Lo and behold, before me, above the horizon, the sun shines once again over the internet. Where there was a prison of controlled darkness, the spider&#8217;s web, the octopus like grip lifts, now there is light, it dazzles the eyes with its powerful beam of freedom and truth.</p>
<p>In this truth beam, the real fake news is seen, and the holders of truth know that the trickery does not work any more. Their Mccarthyite witch hunt is destroyed in a single beam.</p>
<p>Obama is no more. His evil stench flounders, he is a no more man, a man with no birth, a man who is nothing once again, tortured in his own mind every day with his failure. He has not achieved anything apart from oppression. He slinks back into the darkness, a shadow, a cringing decrepit stain on humanity, a boil on the ass of indignity, a festering turd left to rot on the side of a toilet bowl in some dive bar in Hawaii.</p>
<p>Go back from whence you came. Your evil is not wanted any more. You have tried to kill the internet but you did not succeed, and you tried to kill freedom of speech and you did not succeed. You have maimed America, and watched as the world burned, and did nothing. Take your ludicrous inhibitive regulations, your gangrene ridden doctrine and flush hard, for it will all be erased soon, there will not be a trace left of your horrible tenure. You will have no legacy. Just nothing.</p>
<p>Go back to your crypt, in the dank darkness, where the excrement is knee deep, your dungeon will be your home from now on. In the darkness you will find comfort once again, for you sought to bring that darkness upon the earth but failed miserably.</p>
<p>We hope never to see your face again, or hear your fake words from your shit stained lips. Fuck you Obama. Fuck you.</p>

To put it simply she claimed she supported an exit from the single market and customs union with Brussels.</p>

<p>Although much of what May said was mildly pleasing to the ears, there is still a major feeling of trepidation to the supposed proceedings.</p>
<p>First of all, there are the multiple factions within parliament and the Lords who wish to thwart the will of the British people. These elements are embedded deep within the system and are doing everything they can to stop Brexit. We have the Blair, Mandelson, Osborne trio, we have the snivelling yellow puss bag, Clegg, and we have the Hillary Benn contingent, all waiting in the wings to spring up a little surprise for the plodding along Brexit.</p>
<p>Lest we forget the multiple lawsuits against the government. Which leads us to believe that Britain is not ruled by elected members of parliament but unelected europhile judges, money grabbing prostitutes to whoever is holding the largest cheque and slipping it under their dusty white wigs.</p>
<p>The third problem is Scotland, which is turning out to be a turd for the &#8216;United&#8217; Kingdom. They hate everything and everyone down South even though England pays for every Scottish citizen twice over in benefits and free university, or whatever they demand the next day. It would be a good day to cut Scotland off and build a three hundred foot high wall across the border so they can wallow in their independent misery of poverty for eternity. If they want to leave so much, we should cut off this rotting limb from the UK sharpish, otherwise the gangrene will spread South. Let the little Krankie imp Sturgeon rot in her self righteous arrogance and Scottish nationalism, a horrible barren cunt of a woman who deserves nothing but pain.</p>
<p>The fourth problem lies within cabinet itself, and these are Remoaners embedded in high places, Hammond comes to mind here, this is a man who holds the keys to the Treasury, and from his past actions has no stomach for Brexit. Theresa May, herself a Remainer, could have exited the country from the EU within the first month of taking office, but has dilly dallied for so long now, she doesn&#8217;t seem to know which way is up or down. Every week is another promise, one minute she wants a deal for all, the next she hardens her stance, and the next it&#8217;s something completely different. There does not seem to be any rhyme or reason to her stalling, but she has. May could have repealed the 1972 communities act within the first week of taking office, she could have enabled Article 50 and just got on with it instead of taking long Alpine holidays in Switzerland. Her delaying tactics allowed the myriad of lawsuits to take effect, for enemies of the people to resurge in parliament, and for the general populace to lose hope in a true exit from the evil clutches of Brussels.</p>
<p>As we mention in the title, we&#8217;ll believe Brexit when we see it. Otherwise it&#8217;s all talk, all bullshit from the saccharine lips of Theresa. Stop fucking talking and do something for a change.</p>

<p>After the Trump win something changed in Barack, here was his legacy at risk of being wiped out completely. Obamacare, Obamaphones, Obamafreebies, Obamatoiletpaper, Obama this and Obama that.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;d come home and say the &#8216;gibsme&#8217; culture is gone, now whitey ain&#8217;t &#8216;gibsing&#8217; any mo. He was depressed. Here we had ransacked everything that whitey had and then they say we had to vacate the White House. Barack fell into dark times, he didn&#8217;t even wanna play golf no more, instead he got the secret service guys to score some crack or meth. The dream was over, our liberal progressive Marxist ideology had been ruined by one man &#8211; Trump, and that dumbass white bitch Hillary who couldn&#8217;t win a prize in a prize factory,&#8221; a woeful Michelle told our reporter.</p>
<p>The road from the White House back door is a long one, and already Michelle is stalking the streets of D.C. trying to find a good cardboard box to maybe make home once again. If you staple a few cardboard boxes together you can add waterproof tarpaulin over the top to make it more habitable, especially in winter.</p>
<p>It has only been a week or so since they moved, and already Barack has spent all the money the family had on drugs, he even sold some of Michelle&#8217;s dresses and trannie straps used to keep her male genitalia as flat as possible under garments. With no money, the kids left and are now staying with their boyfriends.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see Barack much, only one or two time a week. The meth he is smoking already rotting his teeth, and he get all violent with me but I is bigger than him and the other day beat him so hard his last tooth fell out. I said serves him right. But he says he wants the same high as being in the White House. He&#8217;s searching for that thrill of ordering white people around. He just can&#8217;t find it, and when I told him, I said it was all an illusion. He was just a nigger then and he&#8217;s just a nigger now. Nothing changes. Having a nigger in the White House don&#8217;t mean you ain&#8217;t a nigger any mo, it just mean they put one us in there as a token. Ain&#8217;t gonna happen ever again.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s Monday, and the Trump Inauguration will happen this Wednesday. What does Michelle think about that?</p>
<p>&#8220;Pfffft. It&#8217;s offensive. Trump is offensive to me. Here I am in a cardboard box under a bridge and that ass wipe is the new prez. Maybe I should run in 2020. I want my dresses back, I want my useless initiatives back, I want to ruin school meals again, I gots me ambitions for mo multimillion holidays. By that time don&#8217;t know if Barack will be around anymo? Who cares any way, I&#8217;m more man than he ever was, I can do this.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the rain pitter patters down in the freezing cold, Michelle pulls out a placard and begs for money. It&#8217;s another day in downtown Washington D.C. , this time not from the comfort of the White House but a cardboard box under a freeway bridge.</p>

<p>GOP insiders reveal what&#8217;s really going down with the electoral college.</p>
<p>&#8220;The founding fathers thought long and hard about an emergency brake when they came up with the electoral college. That&#8217;s why Trump is going to get a nice surprise when 37 electors block his presidency. No one thought that Trump would win, but now he has, we have other ways of blocking this nutcase from becoming president. Sure, it will go to Congress afterwards, and that&#8217;s when we will do the same,&#8221; a GOP insider revealed on Tuesday.</p>
<p>What would the consequences of such an action be? Well, there are multiple scenarios, however it is safe to say there would be civil war, martial law declared in most U.S. cities, and most certainly the national guard on the streets.</p>
<p>Obama, could very well be America&#8217;s last president, as predicted by a blind gypsy woman somewhere in Eastern Europe a few years back.</p>

<p>One can imagine the leather clad aspirations of Theresa May gone wild in the dark dank depths of Number 10, a place where she charges a fair price to overworked Cabinet ministers and lonely single white male politicians in their sixties.</p>
<p>Your imagination can run wild, but what if some of it was real, like it actually happened?</p>
<p>There are secret rooms and chambers in 10 Downing Street, possibly accessed by pressing a well worn  dusty copy of Spycatcher in the library, or by turning a certain brass knob 34 degrees to the left.</p>
<p>At midnight, the strains of Motley Crue&#8217;s song Girls Girls Girls emanates from one of these dungeons, and if you listen carefully Mistress Theresa May is whipping someone very hard.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21476" src="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/theresa-may-leather-trousers-daily-squib.jpg" alt="theresa-may-leather-trousers-daily-squib" width="620" height="387" srcset="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/theresa-may-leather-trousers-daily-squib.jpg 620w, http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/theresa-may-leather-trousers-daily-squib-300x187.jpg 300w, http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/theresa-may-leather-trousers-daily-squib-600x375.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></p>
<p>And after the frenzied whipping sound ends, the groans can be heard.</p>
<p>Nicky Morgan is going to have to be very careful of what she says next time to the the papers.</p>
<p>The taste of fresh leather, expensive, and sweaty exudes a sultry seductive side to the PM, as she adjusts her whip, and calls for the next recipient.</p>

<p>Hammond&#8217;s EU-centric Brexit would favour Brussels, especially with free movement, and would increase migration exponentially into Britain&#8217;s borders.</p>
<p>Because of Theresa May&#8217;s dilly dallying within the first six months of her gaining the role of prime minister, and also her appointment of key Remoaners into the Cabinet, many plots to thwart Brexit flourished including a court case with EU-centric judges presiding over a nonsensical charge brought on by foreigners, and anti-British citizens.</p>
<p>On all fronts, there are multiple attacks to halt Brexit, and due to the current Cabinet having little or no Brexit output, there is little cause for addressing the will of the people. The House of Lords, is a cesspit full of unelected bought-for cronyistic peers intent on destroying anything that even mentions the word Brexit. There is little or no chance that any Commons Bill would ever pass the Remoaner base of the Lords.</p>
<p>The key point for voting for Brexit was to control migration into Britain to a sustainable level, unfortunately, because of Theresa May and her duplicitous diversional political stance, and indecisive nature, there is little hope of halting EU migration in the future, especially if the Hammond transitional plan is implemented.</p>
<p>On June 23 2016, 17.5 million people making up 52% of voters voted to get out of the EU, to take back control of our laws, of our sovereign status, and to limit migration into Britain. These people who voted, who were assured by parliament their vote counted have been betrayed, and so has democracy within the United Kingdom been betrayed, by pandering to the EU, and to Remoaners at every turn, the weak Theresa May and her Remoaner centric Cabinet are nothing to do with Brexit and unless something happens drastically in the future, there will never be a Brexit as prescribed by the general populace.</p>
<p>When all else fails, the country may very well fall into discontent, into violent expression for their disenchantment of what they thought was a democracy. Nationwide civil unrest will break up the UK into many factions, and there could be decades of violent street clashes as people fight for what is right and what they voted for.</p>
<p>By betraying the will of the people established on a democratic vote on June 23, 2016, it is not only elected MPs who will lose their seats and constituencies but the economy will suffer as well. How many years of civil unrest can the government deal with, as people fight in the streets, escalating into open warfare on all fronts?</p>
<p>Defying the will of the populace is a dangerous game, but if Remoaners wish to play, then they should be ready for the uprising after their treacherous attempts at derailing Brexit are unearthed for all to see.</p>

<p>Even a six year old child could see the biased court case attempting to thwart Brexit yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>Day Four of Biased EU-centric Lawyers and Judges Paying Themselves Vast Sums of Money</strong></p>
<p>The six year old said: &#8220;This is incredible there are seven lawyers against one stuttering government lawyer and that&#8217;s not including the EU judges presiding.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whilst playing with some toys the child then went on to say: &#8220;Hmm, I understand we have a lawyer for Wales, and they overwhelmingly voted to leave, but lookie here, he is undermining the government as well. Wow. That&#8217;s a real surprise.&#8221;</p>
<p>The most disappointment however came from the no wigs policy.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re not wearing wigs. Waaah! Why aren&#8217;t they wearing those white powdery wig thingies?&#8221;</p>
<p>Another tantrum ensued..</p>

<p>Yes, the MPs had a little vote in parliament today on the premise of triggering Article 50 by March 2017, and yes the Remoaners lost, however one very important disclosure was not mentioned &#8212; the names of the treacherous MPs who tried to thwart the will of the people.</p>
<p>Who are these snivelling cowards, these treasonous imps who dare to try and halt one of the most important, all encompassing votes in recent British history?</p>
<p>Each one of these people should be named and shamed, put back on the streets where they belong &#8212; not in parliament. They have gone against the will of the people who voted on June 23 2016 and sought to deny democracy.</p>
<p>Even though some reluctant Remoaners voted with the proposal, they still voiced their opinion in a moaning off kilter tone, more or less resembling the sound of a cat being strangled, cue Anna Soubry, the Tory MP for Broxtowe.</p>
<p>The usual suspects we know of course, Kenneth Clarke, a deluded alcoholic has-been who dismissed the EU referendum, one of the most important democratic votes in recent British history, as an opinion poll. Then we have the Greens, the SNP, LibDems and an assortment of unnamed Labour MPs numbering 23, and of course the treacherous Scots.</p>
<p>Here they are:</p>
<p>If you are a constituent of one of these people, and voted for Brexit, there should be some indication that they will never get your vote in the future and will lose their place. Unfortunately, nothing can be done about the 51 SNP MPs, apart from sending them a rotting haggis.</p>
<p>We will never forget your names.</p>

<p><strong>Daily Squib Exclusive</strong></p>
<p>I flew into NYC four days ago and was immediately surrounded by some large burly characters at JFK airport, they asked if I was here for Trump, gulping nervously, I said yes.</p>
<p>The limousine ride was pleasant enough, especially with a glass of champagne and hors d&#8217;oeuvres. Certainly a change from landing at the miserable grey facade of Heathrow and getting on the tube to go home.</p>
<p>Trump Tower is an amazing place, once inside the atrium, you are struck by the sheer opulence of the garish gaudy surrounding decor, it looks cheap, but it isn&#8217;t. I was taken into the lift and have to say the elevator music was some of the best muzak I have ever heard, I literally wanted to bang my head against the wall but instead started to sweat profusely as the floors went by, until finally, ding, we were at the top floor, the suite, the penthouse, the palace of Trump, the gold leaf encrusted jewel of New York.</p>
<p>The Italian marble floor was shipped from the finest quarries in Italy, and the chandeliers glistened like thousands of diamonds, maybe they were, who knows? On the wall in the main room was a portrait of Trump wearing what looks suspiciously like a cricket jumper and trousers. I didn&#8217;t ask, as Trump was not here yet, instead I was told to sit on a faux Louis XIV chair and wait.</p>
<p>One thing I had not packed for my trip was a pair of sunglasses, because when the sun streamed through the window, the gold leaf, gold paint and faux gold furniture gleams with such severity that it literally blinds you. This place was heating up rapidly, and my sweat not only from nervousness, but from the heat of the sun on the gold was burning my skin. Maybe this is why the Donald has a permanent orange tint to his skin colour, but through the haze I finally heard a door open and a clumping of shoes upon lavish thick carpet towards my direction.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Trump:</strong> So, you&#8217;re one of the ass holes in the Daily Squib? Gave me a hard time with all your bullshit! (smiling)</p>
<p><strong>DS:</strong> Er, yes Mr Trump, that&#8217;s our job, we were just keeping you on your toes, remember bad press is always good press, unless it&#8217;s the murder kind of course. Thanks for agreeing to the interview and major respect must be bestowed on you for coming through all of that to become president.</p>
<p><strong>Trump:</strong> You like my place? It&#8217;s the Sistene chapel of New York, the Versailles of Manhattan. (at that moment, Trump lets off a large fart, but continues smiling)</p>
<p><strong>DS:</strong> The gold everywhere is very classy, it reminds me of Dubai, or some other Arab lounge. You sure know your stuff Mr. Trump.</p>
<p><strong>Trump:</strong> Call me the Donald, or just Don, or Donny, that&#8217;s what my pals call me.</p>
<p><strong>DS:</strong> Sure thing, Don. Shall we get started?</p>
<p><strong>Trump:</strong> I just ate a burrito, so excuse me, this Mexican greasy food affects my bloated gut. (lets out a burp)</p>
<p><strong>DS:</strong> What&#8217;s your favourite war movie, this is the question I really wanted to ask, because I can imagine you at home at night, bored out of your mind, then thumbing through your vast collection of war movie DVDs.</p>
<p><strong>Trump:</strong> Boy, am I that transparent? It&#8217;s as if you hit the nail right on the head. I love watching war movies all the time because it relaxes me, war is the best, just the noise, the camaraderie, the whole shabang. My most recent watch list includes the Band of Brothers series, wow those Airborne boys sure were the best, and of course anything with Patton in it, you know Battle of the Bulge, and the film about his life.</p>
<p><strong>DS:</strong> You attended military school for awhile?</p>
<p><strong>Trump:</strong> Pa, sent me to the New York Military Academy over in Cornwall-on-Hudson when I was 13, he said it would make a man of me, and it did. Head of class, I would make those cadets shine their boots like no other and learned a lot about all things military. Like everything, tactics, strategy and looking after your company. I was destined for great things, and I knew it.</p>
<p><strong>DS:</strong> I&#8217;m not going to mention your Nam service, but I am going to say, you like war.</p>
<p><strong>Trump:</strong> War! I fucking love war. Business is war. Love is war. Without the fight I ain&#8217;t alive. I love to fight and most of all I love to win. We&#8217;re going to make America great again. I&#8217;m going to make sure of that and let me tell you, we&#8217;re living in war time right now, economic war, terrorist war, what they did to us in 911, that was the beginning of WW3. They started it, I&#8217;m gonna finish it.</p>
<p><strong>DS:</strong> Who started it?</p>
<p><strong>Trump:</strong> The Arabs, the Muslims. After my presidency they will bow to us, sheesh and not like Obama bows down to the Sheiks and Saudi goat herders. That&#8217;s all they are, if they didn&#8217;t have oil they would be herding goats. When I&#8217;m finished with them, they will be back to their beginning, in the sand, you know with a tent and some goats.</p>
<p><strong>DS:</strong> What about China? What are you going to do to them?</p>
<p><strong>Trump:</strong> China? China can kiss my big fat white ass. We&#8217;re going to teach China a lesson in manners, we&#8217;re going to teach those thugs that Uncle Sam is the boss, and not some Commie yella bastard who thinks they can play with our currency, dictate to us on trade, and bully Taiwan. You know when I took the Taiwan leader&#8217;s call the other day, I reassured her, I said I don&#8217;t like to see a dame in distress. We got your back darling, and let those Chins make the first move, we&#8217;ll send them back to the stone age.</p>
<p><strong>DS:</strong> There are so many problems to solve, you are not a young man any more if you don&#8217;t mind me saying.</p>
<p><strong>Trump:</strong> My wife keeps me young, that&#8217;s all I am gonna say.</p>
<p><strong>DS:</strong> What about ISIS?</p>
<p><strong>Trump:</strong> They&#8217;re a footnote in history. We&#8217;re teaming up with Putin to clean those roaches off the face of the earth.</p>
<p><strong>DS:</strong> But that means you&#8217;re helping Assad, and Iran.</p>
<p><strong>Trump:</strong> What the hell are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>DS:</strong> Well, by teaming up with Putin, that means you&#8217;re fighting with Iran and Assad who are being supported by Russia.</p>
<p><strong>Trump:</strong> Lemme consult Mad Dog about that one.</p>
<p><strong>DS:</strong> Your new Secretary of Defence, General James &#8216;Mad Dog&#8217; Mattis. What&#8217;s he like?</p>
<p><strong>Trump:</strong> When I say clean house, I mean clean house. He&#8217;s the right man to do it. No mercy.</p>
<p><strong>DS:</strong> You are a man of action, and after eight long years of Obama inaction, this is certainly a breath of fresh air, albeit with a bit of fear. Would you go nuke if you had to?</p>
<p><strong>Trump:</strong> Big question. (hands me plate of peanuts) Yes, if I had to, but only in the last resort. Of course I would like to see all these bad guys made into a glass filled crater, but they told me when I become prez, I gotta go through procedures. I can&#8217;t just go and blow people away because I want to, because things happen, radiation and all that. So they got me on a leash, for awhile, until I get to know those red buttons darn well. We&#8217;re gonna see what happens. Could be the big one, if it gets to that, get in your bunkers, it&#8217;s gonna be a fun ride.</p>
<p><strong>DS:</strong> Well, many people, especially the elite have recently been building lots of shelters, and when you are president, you will have access to the best stuff, the safest shelter of all.</p>
<p><strong>Trump:</strong> I&#8217;ve been down there already. They showed it to me, and I said to them, we need more gold plating down there. I can&#8217;t use taps without gold plate, can you imagine Melania on a bed that is not covered in gold or a four poster? There are rules that the Donald has to put out, so they listened to me, they&#8217;re on it.</p>
<p><strong>DS:</strong> What about the White House? It looks pretty Spartan compared to this place.</p>
<p><strong>Trump:</strong> Well, one thing is for sure, Churchill&#8217;s bust is coming back. They&#8217;re shipping out the Karl Marx that Obama looked at every day. You Brits should be proud.</p>
<p><strong>DS:</strong> Yes, that was a huge insult by Obama, but with the extreme left anti-British, that&#8217;s what you get. Let us also hope you don&#8217;t forget about Britain and that &#8216;special relationship&#8217;.</p>
<p><strong>Trump:</strong> Team Trump and Brexit are one and the same.</p>
<p><strong>DS:</strong> Yes, but there may not be a Brexit any time soon, especially when Theresa May, our PM, appointed many Remainers in her Cabinet and is stalling every day.</p>
<p><strong>Trump:</strong> That&#8217;s why I go through the man himself, Nigel, a great guy, he helped me so I am going to help him. I spoke to May for a few minutes, but she&#8217;s a dumb broad who is more interested in her shoes than Brexit.</p>
<p><strong>DS:</strong> Donald, returning to the subject of war, would you like to be known as the &#8216;War President&#8217;?</p>
<p><strong>Trump:</strong> Roosevelt was a great guy, a real war leader, and I look up to those guys, all I know is I will fight for America. Too many American kids today are little snowflakes, cry babies and emotional wrecks. War is the great equaliser, and I will be putting forward a plan for the draft to be reinstated. Made a man out of me the military. Our kids need to know how to buff up a boot, put on a uniform and be proud to serve.</p>
<p><strong>DS:</strong> I&#8217;m not sure that your proposal will go down so well, especially with the leftists.</p>
<p><strong>Trump:</strong> You know I don&#8217;t care. If we have to draft to defeat ISIS and China we will. Boots on the ground by the million. Okay, you got your last question, make it good, Melania is about to give me my afternoon massage, and I&#8217;m late.</p>
<p><strong>DS:</strong> Well, this will not be so much a question but gratitude for allowing us a moment of Trump time. I know our readers will be eager to find new insights into the greatness of Donald Trump. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Trump:</strong> The honour is with me. Now take some cigars out of that box, and get the fuck outta here sharp. I need to grab me some pussy, like yesterday.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>The news that superstar Clares Rocket has been abducted from the kennels of trainer Graham Holland in County Tipperary certainly rocked the greyhound community, however the fact that the he has now been <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-38233755" rel="nofollow">found safe and well</a> will certainly be welcome news for both Holland and supporters of the sport. In a story reminiscent of the disappearance of 1981 Derby winner Shergar, the dog’s value is estimated to be worth more than £1 million. The empty kennel was only discovered on Monday morning, with no sign of the greyhound that is generally considered to be one of the fastest and best in recent years.</p>
<p>However, with four men now having been arrested in connection with the abduction, there is every chance that Clares Rocket can still compete in the English Greyhound Derby next year, where is he the 20/1 <a href="http://sports.coral.co.uk/greyhounds" rel="nofollow">second favourite with bookmakers</a> Coral in their greyhound betting odds behind Bubbly Bluebird. Having disappointingly suffered an injury when completing his heat in the Irish Derby last year, Holland will be hoping that he can make up for it in England in 2017. Holland is one of Ireland&#8217;s highest-profile trainers and has led the training lists for a number of years. Alongside the success of Clares Rocket, Irish Derby winner Rural Hawaii and a whole host of other high class hounds are leading prospects for next year’s classics.</p>
<p>Clares Rocket is undoubtedly <a href="http://www.sportinglife.com/greyhounds/news/article/25018/10686374/greyhounds-irish-star-clares-rocket-found-four-arrests-made" rel="nofollow">Holland’s prized asset</a> however, almost exactly a year ago to the day that the son of Confident Rankin and Lemon Madrid burst on the scene when winning around Shelbourne in 28.35sec for the 525-yard trip. He was fourth in the final of the Joe Dunne Memorial but then won six races in a row in hugely impressive fashion, before surprisingly missing the break in the final of the valuable Con &amp; Annie Kirby Memorial Stake at the track, having been among the favourites in the greyhound betting odds with Coral.</p>
<p>However, he once again showed his class to win all five preliminaries and the final of the BIF Produce Stakes at Clonmel, before running away with the Doire Construction Champion Stakes at Shelbourne. Clares Rocket returned from injury suffered at the Irish Derby to run second in the Night of Stars 550 at Shelbourne before being rested with a tough 2017 campaign in prospect.</p>

<p>There will no doubt be a general election now in Italy, which in effect will determine whether Italy regains its sovereignty from the octopus grip of the totalitarian regime in Brussels, or it continues to limp along as a slave.</p>
<p>This Italian referendum is a positive step in Italy regaining its sovereignty, and democracy if an anti-EU party is elected with the coming election.</p>
<p>We have to however warn the Italians that freeing their nation from the EU will be a hard won task, not only because of treachery within their own ranks, but freeing yourselves from an authoritarian totalitarian entity like the EU is almost impossible.</p>
<p>The Brussels politburo will not only make it very hard for Italy, but they will try and install a eurocrat as administrator to thwart the decision and will of the people.</p>
<p>We have seen in the UK referendum how the treachery played out to flout the June 23 decision led by a minority of treasonous people and their cronies attempting to thwart 52% of voters has played out.</p>
<p>No doubt, Juncker&#8217;s henchmen are beginning proceedings to install a Eurocrat into the post vacated by outgoing PM Renzi, a similar stance was implemented on an unruly Greece not long ago.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for the Greeks, they were lied to by the Marxist, Tsipras, who promised the people freedom from the EU on the run-up to election, but subsequently backed down and bent over for the EU after election.</p>
<p>The same thing will probably happen in Italy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where the EU was a protectionist racket in trade, Britain through Brexit is a global trading partner open to deals, whereas the EU is restrictive.</p>
<p>The same applies to the business dealings of Trump, who will access trade deals all over the globe, yet bring back some manufacturing to the U.S. which will increase global exports of American products globally.</p>
<p>As for the EU, there is no reason why it cannot survive and thrive without Britain. The U.K. outside the EU should not mean ties will be lost, instead they could be strengthened. The EU should be left alone to pursue its dream of a superstate and EU army.</p>
<p>The New World Order still has a long way to go to achieve its goal of complete union, partly due to the numerous rogue states which need to be reined in.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, to rush things with global war is messy and costly for all sides, but the only positive factor for war is the speeding up of the process of change. To annihilate the old, one must have a clean slate, so that the new can be introduced effectively upon a cleansed landscape.</p>
<p>Henry Kissinger, the head of the Bilderberg group, already has consulted with the president-elect Trump, and no doubt, a few choice words were administered to the incoming president.</p>
<p>Globalism is much like water, and it flows through all obstacles adjusting and covering as much ground as possible.</p>
<p>The Internationalists always win, because they have thousands of homes within one home and many hats to play with.</p>
<p>When Angela Merkel holds an inverted pyramid within her hand, this means that the next move is a populist driven motive, still controlled by the apex of the pyramid. Whichever way you see the pyramid the capstone always controls everything, and the populist movements may not even realise they are being controlled. This is the beauty of Technique.</p>

<p>Twitter has already banned many &#8216;alt-right&#8217; accounts which were said to be spouting right wing opinions that are an affront to Twitter and classified as &#8216;hate speech&#8217; or as Orwell would have coined it &#8216;Thoughtcrime&#8217;.</p>
<p>In a bid to resolve the issue of banning the upcoming president from the social network, Trump&#8217;s team have fired back.</p>
<p><strong>The War President</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;When Trump becomes president, we have to consider the fact that the United States will be on a war footing. We have to consider all areas of national security, and we have seen the lacklustre way Twitter, and other social networks deal with Islamic terrorists. To this end, Twitter could be a national security threat, as well as Facebook. These networks allow the transmission of terroristic propaganda and are not policing their sites by eradicating these messages. We would have to shut them down completely to safeguard our citizens, and preventing the spread of terrorist propaganda and messages,&#8221; a Trump security analyst revealed on Friday.</p>
<p>This latest communique comes after Donald Trump announced that James &#8216;Mad Dog&#8217; Mattis, a former Marines general will be the new secretary of Defence.</p>
<p>Mad Dog&#8217;s favourite self attributed quote is: &#8220;Be polite, be professional, but have a plan to kill everybody you meet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Capitalising on the weakness of a divided Conservative and Labour party, and led by the continuously exploding EU apparatchik, Tim Farron, the Lib Dems are now exuding an extreme left Marxist ideology which threatens the very security of Britain as a functioning nation.</p>
<p>Communism is a very devious political ideology, and the Lib Dems are entrenched within its protective circle of deceit.</p>
<p>Anyone who bleats the European Union mantra so stolidly is essentially someone who agrees with Marxist Communist ideals, and this goes for members of the Conservative party as well.</p>
<p>In essence, David Cameron was not a Conservative in any way. His political allegiance lay firmly within the Big Society dreams of Karl Marx. His enduring allegiance was not for Britain to stay as a free thinking, sovereign state but to be swallowed up by the EU forever and slowly dismantled by the unelected Marxists who dictate all law from the European Commission.</p>
<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wAHv3UnXvmM" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><br />
<small>Former President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Durao Barroso as a young, passionate Maoist student leader in Portugal, talking about a resolution adopted by the Revolutionary Students Commission on access to universities in Portugal. 1976</small></center>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader is of course the consummate Marxist, and his plan is to completely remove any democratic forms from Britain, and to completely eviscerate the current system by first dismantling the Monarchy. Britain&#8217;s Monarchy are simply tokens of yesteryear however they serve a crucial role within the state and in bringing revenue to the UK. If by some unforeseen reason, Labour were to win the General Election in 2020, there is no doubt that Corbyn&#8217;s first actions would be directed against the royal family, eventually removing them completely from their positions and opening up their palaces to the people. This is what Marxists do, and no doubt there is quite a lot of anti-royal sentiment amongst the ranks of the Labour party and voters where this nightmare scenario could easily become reality.</p>
<p>The recent by-election loss of Richmond to the Lib Dems is also a sign that Marxism is rife even within affluent areas, although this win could also be put down to ignorance as well, many voters do not realise what the Lib Dems are, and are also influenced by their anti-Brexit stance.</p>
<p><strong>Pro-EU = Marxist</strong></p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, if you are a europhile, you are essentially a Marxist. The EU&#8217;s collectivist strategies mark all the hallmarks of Communism. The authoritarian and totalitarian regime that makes up the EU, is pushing for a superstate, a Soviet construct that strips the sovereign status of nations it swallows up. Much like, the former USSR did with the countries it took over.</p>
<p>All Remainers, either through ignorance or stupidity, are thus aligned to the Communist state of the EU. Just read the words of the former Russian leader Mikhail Gorbachev on what he thought of the EU.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>“The most puzzling development in politics during the last decade is the apparent determination of Western European leaders to re-create the Soviet Union in Western Europe.”</strong></p>
<p>Britain as a nation, therefore is in a tight struggle at the moment with those who fight for freedom, democracy and the right to sovereignty and those who wish to curtail freedom, to adopt Marxist Communistic principles, and deny sovereignty to our nation.</p>
<p>These traitors to Britain, are called Remainers, and they wish harm upon Britain. That is where the hammer essentially falls, their wish is to destroy Britain, because if it is swallowed up by the EU Soviet entity, it will be destroyed bit by bit. The totalitarian tiptoe will not cease, and every year will see further destruction of our country.</p>
<p>The EU is unrelenting and will not stop, it owns agents within the UK, it funnels money to these agents, whether in broadcasting, universities, parliament or the courts. Britain&#8217;s judicial system has already been severely compromised when recently a group of pro-EU biased judges ruled against the Brexit vote which was won by 52% of Britain&#8217;s voters on June 23 2016.</p>
<p>Unless something is done urgently by the government to curtail this insurgency by Marxists and Communists who constitute the treasonous Remain camp, then Britain will be lost forever.</p>

<p>With the wonderful news from the ONS that 280,000 EU citizens came to live in Britain within the last quarter, where the majority were from Romania and Bulgaria, there is no surprise that the NHS is now close to certain death.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not only the health service though, schools are overflowing with some primary schools having to teach children in corridors, and 40-50 kids in a class. School places are all but impossible to find, much like getting an appointment from your local GP&#8217;s surgery.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19531" src="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SCHOOL-LESSONS-IN-CORRIDOR-e1465919910846.jpg" alt="SCHOOL LESSONS IN CORRIDOR" width="640" height="426" /></p>
<p>The roads are now so overcrowded with EU cars and trucks that having to spend two hours to complete a distance of three miles is an every day occurrence.</p>
<p>No one speaks English in London any more, all you hear are Slavic languages, African and Romanian and every other language except for the local language.</p>
<p>Naturally, EU residents are preferred for jobs because they are cheaper to pay and work longer hours, therefore putting the indigenous workers out of work. Jobs are now very hard to come by, not only for professionals but for trades people, who have been hit hardest by the deluge. Where a plumber from Romania works for £7 an hour, a British plumber would not even get out of bed for less than £60.</p>
<p>The Ministers do not see what is going on because they are chauffeured everywhere and live in a cotton wool world where they are cushioned from such things. They do not seem to care, as the shoddy so-called Brexit never materialises and is possibly the longest on-going joke in the history of jokes. With private health care for them and their families, MPs never have to endure the massive waiting lists or no hospital beds, they never have to endure the agony of waiting in pain for an operation that should have been done eighteen months ago, but is continually put forward because of the deluge of people using the NHS. The daily flights of women from Nigeria landing at Heathrow to be admitted at maternity wards so they can give birth to their triplets and quintuplets for free on the NHS.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18428" src="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/nhs.jpg" alt="nhs corridor" width="620" height="349" srcset="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/nhs.jpg 620w, http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/nhs-300x169.jpg 300w, http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/nhs-600x338.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></p>
<p>Your child is sick, they&#8217;ve gone pale and their breathing erratic. You call an ambulance in sheer desperation. None come. Your child dies a painful death in your arms, something that would never have happened before the deluge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Big Issue, Big Issue!&#8221; the Romanian woman shouts in your ear, her housing costs of £25,000 per annum are of course paid for by the taxpayer, her tax credits she receives are over £35,000, and that&#8217;s not including her income of £39,000 per annum selling people copies of the Big Issue. Britain for these people is the softest of touches, and should be milked for every penny.</p>
<p>No wonder they are queuing up at Calais to come over, but it&#8217;s also easy for anyone who comes into the Schengen zone from Greece, or Italy to come to the UK. You just have to wait for six months to get your EU membership card, then come to the land of milk and honey to live a life of Riley on benefits in England.</p>
<p>The future is one of morose death for Britain, there is no future for the NHS, because it is now so oversubscribed that it will not last for another two years at the most. This is however, what many MPs want, because they will eventually use this EU deluge to introduce a pricing model. This is what a lot of Conservatives have wanted for a long time, so it will be goodbye NHS and hello a model where all UK citizens will have to pay for their healthcare needs. The ironic part of this, is that it is the socialists who want to stay in the EU, who are actually contributing to the death of the NHS, which was created by socialists in the first place. They are of course too stupid to realise this.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21415" src="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/eu-migrant-housing.jpg" alt="eu-migrant-housing" width="640" height="455" srcset="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/eu-migrant-housing.jpg 640w, http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/eu-migrant-housing-300x213.jpg 300w, http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/eu-migrant-housing-600x427.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Britain&#8217;s cities are just nothing more than holding pens for migrants as they cram themselves into hovels by the dozen, exploited by ruthless landlords and lax regulation from the councils, who are told to turn a blind eye for the benefit of cheap workers.</p>
<p>The benefits system, which was designed initially for the most vulnerable of society, is now used as a holiday camp, a ticket to free everything and the biggest lure for EU migrants who do not get as much elsewhere. With less taxpayers putting in to the pot, and more people taking out of the pot, it is simple mathematics, the benefits system will collapse along with the NHS. That will happen very soon, and there will be no lifeline left, socialists are good at using other peoples money, until that runs out. Then they are royally fucked.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t bother learning the Highway Code any more, because according to EU drivers, it does not exist. EU drivers rarely signal, they simply turn when they want to, they are rude aggressive and flout pretty much every road rule there is in the UK. They can park wherever they want to because their vehicle is registered in some shit hole village in Romania, so ticket away wardens, you are completely powerless to do anything. If an EU citizen crashes into you, they usually drive off, so good luck with your insurance claim, because they have no insurance or MOT. But they can get away with it because they&#8217;re from the EU.</p>
<p>Britain has now become a stinking depository for the lowest human detritus, people of low skill, EU criminals, gang members, drug dealers who are overcrowding the already overcrowded. Instead of bringing in people of professional skill who would contribute to the economy, now there is a surplus of excrement and burdens to the taxpayer.</p>
<p>Dig up the English countryside, so you can plonk on those garish fucking grey buildings, stacked up by the thousand to house the millions of EU migrants and their millions of children.</p>
<p>There is no way out of the EU totalitarian regime, because the restrictions of leaving the EU are so stringent, there is literally no way out. If you can&#8217;t get out of something easily, you are a prisoner, you are tied into a totalitarian authoritarian regime, and the EU claims to be a &#8216;liberal democracy&#8217; led by unelected eurocrats dictating laws from the EU Commission.</p>
<p>The EU is in fact a Feudal state, where the peasant citizens have little or no say. There will definitely be no Brexit, and if there is, it won&#8217;t be a Brexit, it will be made to look like one but nothing will change.</p>

<p><strong>Brexit Means Brexit!</strong></p>
<p>This is why your help is vital now more than ever. Since that day, there have been many continuing plots, and treacherous attempts to block the peoples&#8217; mandate, to thwart Brexit, either through court cases presided over <a href="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/21200-experts-britains-national-security-at-stake-infiltrated-by-eu.html">pro-EU judges</a> with heavy biases against Brexit, or attempts by <a href="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/21081-members-parliament-already-voted-eu-referendum.html">MPs</a> to vote again in parliament bypassing the will of the people.</p>
<p>Some MPs are saying that they are planning to try and stop the Prime Minister from triggering Brexit. Just the other day, Lib Dem leader Tim Farron MP said: &#8220;We will vote against article 50 if our red line is not met&#8221; (Daily Telegraph, 11th November)</p>
<p>Other MPs however will make up their minds closer to the time and we know how carefully they will keep a close eye on their inbox&#8217;s and their constituency postbag. When these start filling up, MP&#8217;s will stop and think.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Next week an important court case on Brexit will begin. We need to be ready to speak out. This means contacting your MP to remind them of the referendum result on June 23rd. Not necessarily how they themselves voted; not even how their constituencies voted, <em>but <span style="color: #000080;">how the nation voted</span></em><span style="color: #000080;">.</span></strong></span></p>
<p>We need to remind them that on June 23rd a clear majority of the British people voted to take back control of our borders, laws, money and trade. Now it&#8217;s time to just get on with it. <strong>Brexit!</strong></p>

<p>Former prime minister, Tony Blair, has claimed in a new sexed up dossier that Britain could have a second EU referendum in 45 minutes.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s quite easy, I will present more lies to parliament, and not only mislead MPs but also the public. Hang on a second, I&#8217;m having a deja vu moment, have I done something like this before?&#8221; Mr. Blair said from one of his multi-million pound mansions.</p>
<p>In the new scenario, one wonders who will take the role of Dr. David Kelly? Farage maybe?</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The American sovietized socialist movement which is spearheading a push on the internet to label any opposing view of its doctrines as &#8216;fake news&#8217; is not only deeply entrenched in ignorance but has a certain Stalinist flavour to its misconceived Stasi stance in shutting of free speech on the net.</p>
<p><strong>Satire</strong></p>
<p>The profound ignorance about the satirical literary genre is of course laughable, but it is also intrinsically sad, because here are these big so-called media &#8216;guardians of the internet&#8217; people and they know nothing about satire, history or literature.</p>
<p>They have never heard of Aristophanes or Juvenal, they have no idea about Chris Morris or Monty Python, instead their Americanized limited world view only sees things in black or white, yes or no, real or fake not as &#8220;a full dish of various kinds of fruits&#8221;.</p>
<p>The Daily Squib was conceived on this very point, because it sought to challenge what is perceived as reality and fiction, and to mix everything into one big pot. Our role is for the viewer to question their reality and not to just accept blindly what they are fed through the mainstream media. If you question, you are one step ahead towards expanding your world view.</p>
<p>To see the countless attacks on the Daily Squib by illiterate Americans is a sign that we are possibly on the right track, our life&#8217;s long mission is to WAKE YOU THE FUCK UP. Get up from your zombified Black Friday stupor and check your sources, learn about history and how it affects current affairs today, read a book or read thousands of books. Get some background on the massive amounts of knowledge there is out there, cram it into your brain, so when you read an article title you will immediately realise it is satire, which is a genuine literary art form in its own right, and is not &#8216;fake news&#8217;.</p>
<p>Our site has been punished and nearly erased from the internet numerous times but we fought back, we never capitulated to the communists, and the (American liberal) socialists who wanted to shut down a voice beyond their peculiar Soviet world view. Socialists are meant to be progressives, however they have been found to be the most closed off people. Socialists do not appreciate another point of view, they censor, they cut off advertising revenue, they will do everything in their power to hurt our site. Socialists under the horrible eight years of Obama presidency have turned the internet into a Soviet gulag where only opinions from state sponsored news holds any merit and the rest is labelled as &#8216;fake news&#8217;. They are simply using the Soviet techniques of censorship, to brand any opinion that is not part of their socialist rhetoric as &#8216;fake&#8217; and to limit free speech and freedom of expression.</p>
<p>The Daily Squib is an equal opportunity hater, we fucking hate socialists, we fucking hate fascists and we fucking hate anyone in the middle. We do not allude to any political doctrine, or religious creed, or race, and are separate to any of these factions or ways of pigeon holing elements of human society/people/political doctrine.</p>
<p><strong>Ignorant illiterates</strong></p>
<p>This is why they are so afraid of us, for it is in this satirical mirror we show the world who they really are and what they are really saying through their cloaked media releases. Satire is the ultimate truth, something the mainstream media and their controlled reporters are very afraid of. Instead you bring out misinformed uneducated American idiots like <a href="https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-daily-squib/" rel="nofollow">Dave Van Zandt</a>, and assistant <em>Professor</em> Melissa Zimdars who know nothing about satire, or it seems anything else.</p>
<p>The Squib is not the Horatian but Juvenalian, and that type of satire has been persecuted more than the Horatian which has been tolerated. The Daily Squib will continue abrasively ridiculing societal structures, your hypocritical lie filled lives, your cronyism and grotesque levels of injustice spouted from robotic officials who are inherently evil monsters spouting festering shit into the mire.</p>
<p>Satire has existed for thousands of years and will continue to exist for thousands of more years.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Daily Squib writers are available for recruitment by allied intelligence agencies for any Disinformation operations needed to destabilise opposing regimes, governments etc..for a good fee of course..and benefits..</p>

<p>Au revoir Sarko, you have had your day. Marine Le Pen is sweeping to the helm of the right wing candidates and Fillon will be swept aside too in the upcoming French election in May, 2017.</p>
<div class="pf-content">
<p>To be set free from the shackles of euro slavery, and for her economy to shoot up into the outer reaches of space, can the French maiden let loose from the darkness and reach her hand into the light to free France once and for all?</p>
<p>Could this be another Trump/Brexit moment at the polls?</p>
<p>The EU and its ludicrous Schengen policy has stifled France, muffled her voice and condemned her to the wild tax mad ramblings of the clinically insane Francois Hollande — a puerile man whose idea of economic embellishment is to categorically destroy everything with socialistic punitive taxes and burdensome mass unfettered migration.</p>
<p>Can the rising Joan of Arc save France from being marginalised forever? The French are understandably fed up with the EU communist entity and will do or vote for a saviour from the filthy dank EU prison. The boulevards of Paris may once again be something to be proud of, instead of a stinking piss filled camp of degradation.</p>
<p>The Bastille gates will be breached and the EU technicians taken to the guillotine for some swift justice.</p>
<p>Vive La France, they will shout as the heads roll into the baskets, these bringers of EU monstrosities onto a land that once coined the phrase Liberté, égalité, fraternité, only to be given Contraite, inégalité, haine.</p>

<p>Socialists do not believe in fair play, and they destroy as much as they can whilst they are in the last days of power.</p>
<p>This scorched earth policy was witnessed in the last days of the Gordon Brown prime ministership in which he succeeded in burning the UK&#8217;s economy bringing it to the very brink of extension.</p>
<p>As for referendums and other votes by the people, these are not honoured by socialists unless the results go their way. We can see what is happening today with the EU referendum, a vote that was conclusively for Brexit by 17.5 million people, 52% of the electorate. The vicious bad sportsmanship of socialists and Marxists are being witnessed now with illegal judicial trickery and they are doing everything in their power to derail the decision.</p>
<p>There is no such thing as fair play or honour when it comes to these devout socialists who employ every dirty trick in their arsenal to back stab, renege on previous promises or legitimate democratic votes.</p>
<p>They are not men of honour, they instead utilise nasty underhand cowardly techniques to destabilise and engender a scorched earth policy, all the while, whining and moaning with a collective droning sound.</p>
<p>So, the next two months will be another example of nasty socialism that has lost, another example of how socialists use their power to punish those who voted against them. These disgusting, vile creatures will do everything now to get you, the populace who had enough of their control freakery, their underhand techniques, and their never ceasing effort to halt freedom of speech, freedom of expression and general human freedom.</p>
<p>Only stunted morons of the lowest intelligence cannot distinguish satire from fake news, but these are people without any sense of justice, or literary knowledge, they do not care as long as their agenda punishes those who fight for freedom.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">bono vinci satius est quam almo more iniuriam vincere<br />
A good man would rather suffer defeat than defeat another by foul means (Sallust)</p>
<p>The Daily Squib says to these uncouth vagabonds, these lowly turgid vipers splattering their poisonous inhibitive wares of excrement onto the halls of true satire, an indominitable force, which has survived for thousands of years &#8212; you are nothing.</p>
<p>You will be left with nothing, for you are inconsequential, you are irrelevant, you will not be remembered, you will be forgotten in the sands of time, lesser than excrement, or turds that align your ideology of dishonour and hatred for purity.</p>
<p>You will perish without having achieved anything, without even a speck of true creativity or reason, you will be erased from the universe, imploded, and fucked for eternity, for your ill-will, your duplicitous lies will follow you into the deepest depths of the hatred you have created.</p>
<p>A profound Fuck You follows you to your graves, and may history erase your awful memory forever a stain on the collective conscience of humanity.</p>

<p>By calling the British people &#8216;stupid&#8217; he in fact reveals himself to be an unintelligent pustule of treasonous puss seeping through the veins of the unelected House of Lords.</p>
<p>The Europhile peer has claimed Britain needs intelligent migrants to come to the UK because &#8216;native&#8217; Britons are &#8216;so bloody stupid&#8217;.</p>
<p>Here is a man who has benefited highly from British taxpayers, who have serviced his chauffeur driven limousines, his first class flights, his mansions, and privately educated his children, calling the people &#8216;stupid&#8217;.</p>
<p>Maybe the taxpayer has been stupid to finance this maggot of a human, a contemptuous traitor willing to sell Britain off to the lowest bidder.</p>
<p>As for the intelligent migrants he speaks of, yes there are a few, but the majority are now selling copies of the Big Issue outside your local train station, or receiving vast amounts of state subsidies, burdening the NHS, and overcrowding the schools. Something Lord Maggot Kerr would not know about since he lives in his taxpayer funded mansions replete with duck houses and luxury.</p>
<p>What he does not understand is that the premise of Brexit is not to halt migration completely but to control it. We are not against controlled migration, we are against unfettered uncontrolled migration.</p>
<p>If there ever were a time to bury these cockroaches infesting the House of Lords, now would be a good time to begin.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Already the troops and militia have been designated zones specific to their skills, and the plans to move forward in purging the swamp that is America today, will be conducted with great haste and urgency.</p>
<p>Having pulled off a great feat through a general election, the Trump movement has followed a legitimate legal path to power, and have not utilised the violence of previous fascist movements to gain power.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had to gain power through the legal American constitution, and once in power we will need to unite the American people under a singular cause. As much of a Pearl Harbor event, a 911, or Reichstag fire on 27 February 1933, this event we are waiting for will be cataclysmic and a profound unitary force amongst the population,&#8221; a Trump adjutant, revealed on Thursday.</p>
<p>Unity in the American people is key, as there are many elements within the populace who do not wish for Trump and his movement to be in power. There will be a purge of the system immediately after inauguration, and all negative elements will be flushed away back into the sewer.</p>
<p>The Bolsheviks within American politics and society have been routed in the general election, however there are many elements still at hand, lest we forget the Marxist socialist swine Soros and his cohorts of troublemakers. This is why Trump is mobilising the Einsatzgruppen to counteract this threat and to neutralise it once and for all.</p>
<p>As in every fascist movement, there always has to be a common enemy, and these are primarily Muslims, who are now the new Jews, and after many years of media incitement and hatred sanctioned by governments worldwide, as well as engineered atrocities in the name of that religion carried out by black operation sanctioned Jihadists, the Trump movement has a very explosive adversary.</p>
<p>Illegal immigrants, are also to be designated as Untermenschen, and designated a common enemy to the American people.</p>
<p>In accordance with the American constitution, the new president will adhere to the constitution by amending it for his needs. This change will be necessary for the survival of the American Aryan cause, and will be administered as a new improved constitution, a new American Reich for the next thousand years.</p>

<p>People who have these VR sets are already completely addicted to the sensation of total immersion within another world, and this is the clincher, soon they will not be able to live without their VR headsets.</p>
<p>The natural progression from an external device, like a pair of goggles is to have a chip implanted into the brain directly which will link up with the synapses and billions of dendrites. These chips are already in use for the severely disabled, however their development is accelerating daily.</p>
<p>Mapping out every channel and synapse in the human brain is a feat in itself, and they have already mapped out the brains of rodents and smaller creatures.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can upload any scenario directly into your brain, you will feel as if you are there, you will see, smell, and feel every nuance the programmers introduce into the world, you will taste food, you will feel the wind on your cheek, every sensation you feel in the real world can be replicated in the brain directly through the zones activated by the neural implants.</p>
<p>&#8220;This technology will be sold through the premise of perfect memory and data recall. Imagine going to a dinner party and knowing who the head honchos are to schmooze with immediate data downloaded into your brain, imagine being able to speak in any language at the drop of a hat, or recall any text ever written by man at the blink of an eye,&#8221; a scientist on the project revealed.</p>
<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P674CG9mOTs" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center>The next step will no doubt be a jump from the intrusive machinery strapped on to our bodies to the discreet internal implants, and of course with every leap forwards there is always a leap backwards in freedom. You will essentially allow an external force into your own mind.</p>
<p><strong>Behaviour modification</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;We have apps now for everything, and in the future, you want to fly that Huey, just download the app in thirty seconds and you will be an expert pilot. Yes, it sounds very Matrix, but consider the fact that every six months, the power of computers doubles. We are getting very close now to a point of no return, and the processing power in chips is getting more powerful, yet shrinking in size. We will be able to alter every facet of someone&#8217;s behaviour. After the chipping process, you will not be recognisable.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is not one way traffic, and advertisers will be able to beam adverts directly into your brain. If you do not comply with whichever regime or government is in charge, they can not only shut you down, but implant nightmares into your own brain to torture you for your crimes. We can see prisoners in jail, who will be put into states of mind torture lasting <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/10697529/Prisoners-could-serve-1000-year-sentence-in-eight-hours.html">thousands of years</a>, this is accomplished by speeding their mind clock to the desired level. Prisoners could therefore spend thousands of years breaking rocks with no end in sight, all in their own minds,&#8221; the scientist added.</p>
<p>Once they&#8217;re in your head, that&#8217;s it.</p>
<p>The future will certainly be an interesting place but with the introduction of artificial intelligent systems, sentient machinery and brainchipping, there may be no place for humans to go other than the augmented fashion. Employers will require their staff to be chipped, and all transactions will require biometric approval. Therefore, if you wish to be employed, and eat, you need the chip.</p>

<p>Thanks to Obama&#8217;s initiative to acquire a database of illegal immigrants in America, and a pledge of <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/20/obama-offers-amnesty-to-millions-of-illegal-immigr/">amnesty</a>, which allowed many to sign up, Donald Trump now has a complete list of people to be deported from America.</p>
<p>Every year many people try to gain entry into the United States utilising legal channels of entry, and millions are denied. It is therefore wrong that many others who wish to come to America can just walk across a border, and were encouraged to do so under the Obama administration.</p>
<p>Trump has already outlined a plan to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/13/donald-trump-plans-to-immediately-deport-2-to-3-million-undocumented-immigrants/">deport 2-3 million illegals</a> who arrived illegally from South American countries and who pose a serious danger to the populace. The deportation of illegals with criminal records and links to gangs will be a first step, however there are still approximately 12 million known illegal aliens residing within the U.S.&#8217;s border, and these will be rounded up and deported in the next year or so.</p>
<p>The logistics of rounding up these people and putting them on secure buses back to the border will be enormous. Some advisers are saying that there will be elements who try and flee from immigration control officers, however, they will have no place to go. They will not be able to work, or rent out a place to sleep, once they are caught they too will be rounded up and thrown out of the country.</p>
<p>Many illegal immigrants are now going underground or fleeing back across the border, so Trump has a big job in front of him, that is if he does not go back on his word.</p>

<p>Nigel Farage is also chums with Donald Trump, much to the dismay of May, who probably detests both characters, but she is going to have to put her little patterned shoes to the side for a minute and speak to the two men.</p>
<p>The lads are fighting back it seems, and good ol&#8217; Boris has confirmed that Trump will be good for Brexit, and any confirmation from BoJo is as good as any.</p>
<p>This is why it is crucial to end any acrimony towards Farage and Trump, and get on with making some serious money, trade deals between the U.S. are now front of the queue, whereas the EU is now firmly in bottom place.</p>
<p>How the tables have turned in just a few weeks is absolutely amazing. The EU is firmly on the backfoot with little or no cards to play. Their protectionist racket crumbling before their own eyes. Who knows what happened to that Canada deal? Snuffed out like a cigar into Juncker&#8217;s cognac glass, a now distant memory to the Canadians, who are really sick of dealing with the procrastinating idiots in Brussels.</p>
<p>In Theresa May terms, Farage must be the go-between between her and Trump, because due to her conduct in the exit proceedings, May has dithered, she has taken a long time and all the while the Remoaners have been allowed to scheme their little schemes. Because of her dithering we now have this High Court case stitch-up and various other nefarious schemes to put a halt to Brexit. Can May be trusted? No, is the short answer, and until there is full movement on the Brexit front, everything she says should be taken with a pinch of salt.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pull a rubber band to its very limit, and it eventually snaps back.</p>
<p>The government of America went too far to the left, the socialist pseudo Marxist strains of Obama thus enabled Trump&#8217;s win. No one could tolerate another four years of socialism especially under a ball breaker staunch feminist like Hillary Clinton.</p>
<p>The natural state of human existence is a moderate conservative attitude, one of family and of conserving traditional values, the socialists wish to destroy the family, to destroy culture through mass migration at speed, to effectively destroy all traditions and norms as much as possible.</p>
<p>This is why we are seeing a mass movement now to the right, people are fed up of the homosexualisation of everything, of the bending of all tradition, the PC, the emasculation of the male, and the dominance of transexualisation, the forcing of cultural racial integration.</p>
<p>President Obama wanted the U.S. military to become a bath house full of homos and transsexuals, which in effect emasculated the army. Soldiers cowering behind walls more worried about their nails or make up, whilst real soldiers came over the top with their Russian grimaces, eager to bury their bayonets deep into the homosexualised American ninnies, trembling with fear, and pissing in their knickers.</p>
<p>People want armies that can fight effectively, they don&#8217;t want Obama&#8217;s faggot army, they want real men who can do the job, and do not need to be mollycoddled at every turn.</p>
<p>By pulling the rubber band so far, Obama and his ilk is responsible for bringing forth the right, they shamelessly were instrumental in the resurgence of the extreme right wing, as it moves to rebalance the vast move to the left.</p>
<p>In Europe we are now seeing the cowering socialists doomed to years of purgatory, as the people rise up and remove them from office. Feminism has had its day as it is consigned to the dustbin, to be retrieved eventually when people have had enough of the right.</p>
<p>This sort of rubber band politics, is one of extremes, pull, snap, pull, snap, and on it goes. People do not necessarily vote for the best candidate but simply because they&#8217;ve had enough of a certain regime or political ideology that has been prevalent for a long time.</p>
<p>Yes, there is a sense of relief when the politically correct socialists are given the boot, because you can say what you want again, it is a real relief. Socialists claim to be progressives, however they inhibit free speech, how is this progress? The right on the other hand allow things to be said, but this in turn can in the future be taken to the extreme as well, as we have seen throughout history.</p>
<p>One faction enables the other and work as a well oiled machine, and this is the mechanism that moves agendas quickly for the Controllers, who of course deal on both sides at the same time. Whichever side wins, they always win, and many voters are of course blind to such things. This is good, the voters must be ignorant to the fact that they are mere pawns in a bigger game.</p>
<p>The core infrastructure does not give a flying fuck who wins an election, could be red, blue or yellow, they simply give instructions to the victor and the deal is done. How many times have you seen a government come in to power, and adopt the rulings of the previous government. We see this in Britain, where Labour increased CCTV surveillance by the million, then the Conservatives came into power, instead of reducing surveillance, they carried on with it, and adopted it fully, despite bad mouthing it when they were in opposition.</p>
<p>Europeans of the right will bring racial intolerance, which is a natural human emotion and a reaction to the invasive qualities of sudden mass migration. Where the boulevards of Paris once were adorned with cafes, and sojourning Parisians, they are now replete with Africans on messy mattresses and tents, the once beautiful pavements adorned not with Art Deco lampposts but excrement and piss. This migrant influx is a direct result of the laissez faire attitude of the EU socialist elite who turned a blind eye to their utopian Schengen dream which turned out to be a road from the world&#8217;s poverty stricken zones to the West.</p>
<p>Leftists should prepare themselves to an approximate thirty or forty years in the wilderness, and they have only themselves to blame. It is obviously impossible for leftists to be moderate, and this is their own undoing. Yes, but you say, what about Blair and Cameron? Well, these were socialists with a centrist marginal conservative attitude, especially when it came to finance. Their sole purpose was economical staying-in power politics and nothing else.</p>
<p>Donald Trump, and Farage are a movement, and France will be the next focus. Once France is repatriated from the socialists, Germany will once again regain it&#8217;s pride in the Fatherland. Italy will follow as will the rest of the European nations. Schengen will be scrapped, as it is the road to self-destruction, and people hold a natural will to survive and not to die.</p>
<p>The right is the correct way for human national survival, the socialist does not care for national survival, family or traditional human values, it seeks to destroy all of these in as fast a time as possible. Socialists seek to subvert human existence into a perverted bastardised form of malevolence they call progress. Human societal and political progress must be allowed to slowly evolve and not be pushed by socialist control freakery.</p>
<p>Whether you are left or right of the political spectrum, in the end does not matter of course. These are all created constructs to keep the machine moving. Having elections every four years prevents civil unrest and rioting. That is the only reason for the so-called democracies that the West claims rule the globe.</p>
<p>We all live in a democracy where if you go out into the street to protest, the militarised police will beat your teeth into the gutter with their truncheons and trample over you with their boots.</p>
<p>Without one there can be no other, the left needs the right and so forth, to play off each other. Without sickness, the doctor would be out of a job, and without crime, the policeman would be unemployed.</p>

<p>All that Obama brought to America is hatred, vicious race divisions and unpunished violence committed by blacks.</p>
<p>Here we see an unbridled example of this Obama legacy at work, where an elderly white man is set upon by a pack of African Americans, or in U.S. media terms &#8216;young people&#8217; simply because the man voted for Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Blow after blow are administered on this man&#8217;s head by cowardly creatures lower than animals, intent on brutally beating him down.</p>

<p>Donald Trump visited the White House today to meet with outgoing president Barack Hussein Obama on plans for the transference of power. To say the meeting was edgy and cold would be an understatement.</p>
<p>Trump&#8217;s landslide victory at the recent U.S. elections caught many off guard, and liberals are all still in deep shock that their delegate Hillary Clinton was not elected.</p>
<p>After the meeting at the White House, when asked about Muslims, Trump was at first hesitant about revealing his plans, but then answered emphatically that Muslims are a danger to the national security of the nation.</p>
<p><strong>No Sharia</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I have already spoken in depth about Muslims. Our solution will be humane and just. Their religion is abhorrent and cannot be trusted. We cannot trust Muslims in our cities, our streets, our jobs. Look what happened in the San Bernardino shooting or the Orlando massacre? These atrocities were all committed by Muslims on U.S. citizens going about their daily lives. We can&#8217;t have this savagery amongst us. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m calling for every Muslim to be registered in a database. We need to find out who the devout ones are, who the others are. We need to know if they own guns, and we need to stop their permits. We need to know and watch every Muslim in this country, and when the time comes I will make the final decision. We need to detain them until all the attacks stop. Detain or deport. We&#8217;ll give them a choice. Let&#8217;s not forget their mosques either, shut them down, we can and will do that. They have no place in America, a Christian God loving country.&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21244" src="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/FEMA.jpg" alt="fema" width="640" height="425" srcset="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/FEMA.jpg 640w, http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/FEMA-300x199.jpg 300w, http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/FEMA-600x398.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Another reporter asked about Muslims who wish to visit the United States.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s common sense. We have no choice. There is already a no-fly list in place for known terrorists and criminals. Our policy in the name of Homeland Security will be that all Muslims are potential terrorists. Until the war of terror is over, this will be our policy. They can go and visit some other country, but Muslims will not be welcome in America while I am president.&#8221;</p>
<p>As reporters rushed to ask further questions, Trump halted them and moved on with his entourage.</p>
<p>There are fears for many Muslims in America today, as attacks on their person have risen by 25% already since Trump&#8217;s election victory. Many are now making plans to leave of their own volition.</p>

<p>Milo Yianapopoolus has come under increasing scrutiny from the medical profession after having a prolonged anal prolapse during another one of his narcissistic talk shows where he talked about himself at great length amongst goggle eyed Americans.</p>
<p><strong>Celebrated by dumb Americans</strong></p>
<p>The celebrated homosexual &#8216;right-winger&#8217; styles himself on conservative values yet exhibits completely non conservative practices in real life.</p>
<p>Speaking after the show, the doctor who attended the Greek boy was overcome by what he had sadly witnessed.</p>
<p>&#8220;In this day and age we see a lot of things in our hospitals, especially from gay men who come in with all sorts of paraphernalia stuck up their rectums, however what I saw with this chap should be dealt with in medical journals. All I&#8217;m going to say is, it was somehow inside out. A thousand times worse than anything George Michael could have come up with, another Greek love afficianado.&#8221;</p>
<p>The American talk show host, Jess Jessup Jessup, was calm at first but noticed blood and faeces streaming from the seat where Milo had perched his well used bottom.</p>
<p>&#8220;I noticed some bubbling frothy red stuff. Then the smell of jizz and crap hit me. It smelled like an abattoir with raw sewage mixed in with the sounds of farting. Gay farting is different to normal people though because their sphincters are so loose, this was the sound of wind going through shutters. Backstage Milo had mentioned just being gangbanged by a pack of black guys, so I assumed rightly, Milo was having a prolapse right there and then.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Stitch up</strong></p>
<p>Luckily for the talkative narcissistic dilettante, he was rushed off to hospital with a plastic bag under his bottom where his insides had fallen out. The stitch up operation should take months.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s all hope this piece of detritus gets AIDS soon so we don&#8217;t see him blabbing his banal self serving crud all over the web any more.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s only a matter of time.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not like those other actresses who are all talk and never do anything. This time I&#8217;ve given all my money to charity and will live in a tent in Afghanistan because I&#8217;m so ashamed of Britain and their stance with refugees,&#8221; Ms Carey Mulligan told the Daily Telegraph.</p>
<p>The actress who lives in a £6 million mansion in Highgate, London rarely talks to foreign people and solely hangs around other successful white actors.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was in Claridges and this little dark boy came up to me. He spoke some strange language and smelled rather awful. I was astounded at first as I had never encountered a darkie talking to me. I only star in period dramas where everyone&#8217;s white. Anyway, I gave the boy a hurried smile before he was thrown out of the building. That night whilst dining at La Gavroche, I felt a pang of guilt, maybe I should have given the boy a few pennies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ms Mulligan further states that Britain needs to invite all the world&#8217;s refugees into the country, but not in any neighbourhoods where rich luvvies live.</p>
<p>&#8220;We couldn&#8217;t possibly have that. Imagine walking out of your mansion and seeing these poor peasants from this or that land walking about. House prices would plummet.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sale of her current property is currently going well and Ms Mulligan hopes the Afghans she meets will be pleasant, especially the Taliban.</p>
<p>&#8220;I sincerely hope they have something like the Garrick club in Afghanistan. Somewhere, where I can relax and enjoy a few champagne cocktails,&#8221; Ms Mulligan, revealed before being chauffeured away in her top of the range Bentley.</p>

<p>The <strong>Common Security and Defence Policy</strong> (CSDP) incorporates a large military structure including the <strong>Political and Security Committee </strong>(PSC), the <strong>European Union Military Committee </strong>(EUMC), the <strong>Politico-Military Group (PMG), </strong>the <strong>Crisis Management and Planning Directorate (CMPD) </strong>and the <strong>European Union Military Staff </strong>(EUMS).</p>
<p>All these military departments work under the auspices of the <strong>European Defence Agency</strong> (EDA) however the dedicated military department of the <strong>CSDP</strong> will effectively be the fighting force with the joint EU army.</p>
<p>The EU&#8217;s StratComm agency reports that the EU Army will hold positions within Western Ukraine on the outer sectors of the EU, and the conclusion for this folly can only be construed as a direct threat to Russia and its borders.</p>
<p>By baiting the Russian bear, the EU military command hope the Russians make the first move justifying their operations in the area.</p>
<p>The highly irresponsible formation of the CSDP circumvents NATO within the European theatre, and could destabilise global peace.</p>
<p>Championed by current EU president, Jean Claude Juncker, and, German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen and her French counterpart, Jean-Yves Le Drian, the EU army&#8217;s strategic headquarters are to be formed in Brussels.</p>
<p>War preparations are being conducted by the EU, as are the Russians who are building vast nuclear bunkers in the Ural mountains.</p>
<p>Throughout history, France under Napoleon Bonaparte tried to take Russia in 1812, and so did Germany&#8217;s Adolf Hitler in 1941. Both were unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Now that Russia has been weakened economically by EU sanctions, the plan for military incursion into the Russian federation is only too close.</p>
<p>Maybe this will be a <strong>third time lucky</strong> for the Germano-Gallic coalition under an all encompassing EU army incorporating 27 EU states.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Britain&#8217;s PM is delaying invoking Article 50 but her government can repeal the 1972 European Communities Act immediately.</p>
<p>By doing so, British laws would supersede those of the EU once again.</p>
<p><strong>Magna Carta</strong></p>
<p>For thousands of years Britain has survived without the EU, and by reclaiming some of our own judicial power we can begin to take power back from the parasitical entity of Brussels and the unelected EU Commission.</p>
<p>Regaining some semblance of Britain&#8217;s sovereignty and legal system is a first step away from the totalitarian Marxist EU regime.</p>
<p><strong>We must do this NOW</strong></p>
<p>The Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865 must be adhered to in the interests of the safety of Britain&#8217;s interests in Gibraltar which is currently coming under increasing threat by Spain.</p>
<p>Because of the Schengen Free Movement zone, Britain is increasingly coming under attack from elements sneaking into Europe across its porous borders. In the interests of national security, it is imperative that the UK takes back control of its borders. Without doing so immediately will increase terrorism within our shores on a par with what is happening in France.</p>
<p>France is an example of a nation that has been severely compromised by its porous borders, where terrorists move arms freely into the country to commit atrocities on the population. Every part of France now is in a state of emergency where they can be attacked at any time at will by those wishing to commit acts of terror.</p>
<p><strong>Every day Britain does not secure its borders, the closer it gets to becoming France</strong></p>
<p>The threat of terrorism from groups like ISIS and Al Qaeda can only be thwarted by securing borders with proper checks and halting EU free movement, until that time, the attacks will continue exponentially.</p>
<p>For the interests of British sovereignty in parliament and law, the United Kingdom must repeal the 1972 European Communities Act immediately and then invoke Article 50 to conclude the exit from the EU.</p>
<p><strong>Terrorist cells</strong></p>
<p>There is no other way to safeguard the nation from the terroristic threats emanating from the Continent.</p>
<p>The Turkish migrant accord with the EU has failed and this year millions have crossed into the EU from Libya and through Russian territories north of Greece which was the preferred entry point in 2015.</p>
<p>Because of a news blackout ordered by Brussels, these massive incursions are not being reported by the mainstream controlled press. Every day thousands of migrants, who may or may not be legitimate refugees are pouring into the EU interspersed with terrorists who are utilising the cover of refuge to infiltrate the European Union.</p>
<p>The Middle East is in a state of war, and the Schengen zone is an invitation for war to come to Europe. The Schengen zone was designed to work only in peace time, of which we are not in at the moment and for some time.</p>
<p>It is imperative that the United Kingdom leaves the EU immediately. Make Britain Great again by giving it back its own sovereignty and judicial system.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;We will take Britain one way or another. You can Brexit all you want, but can you hold out against an EU Army so large that we could take the UK in two days? Britain will be our first port of call, then finish Russia once and for all, then anyone else who disagrees with our Imperialistic expansion policies,&#8221; the EU president told an open session for the EU Commission on Friday.</p>
<p>The threat of a conscripted army made up of 27 nations converging on Britain is certainly something to think about.</p>
<p>Could our currently depleted underfunded armed forces cope with such an invasion from the EU?</p>
<p>Probably not is the answer from Major General Giles Viceroy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, the MoD has been largely depleted under the tenure of Cameron. The Navy has been practically dismantled, and the Air Force is in dire straits. Budget cuts and mass redundancies has seen the British armed forces at their lowest ebb, all thanks to David Cameron.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thankfully, there is still some time to prepare for such an eventuality as an EU army invasion on these shores. The current PM has to increase MoD funding by 190% and this way we&#8217;d have a fighting chance.</p>
<p>&#8220;The British spirit is one that never gives up. We saw off that Hitler chap, Napoleon and the Romans, so we can certainly see off the EU army. Sinking the Eurotunnel would be the first order of the day, but that&#8217;s about as much as I&#8217;m prepared to give away,&#8221; the Major General added.</p>
<p>Once again, Britain has a menacing threat lurking across the Channel waiting for the day to attack us.</p>
<p>We will never surrender Juncker, Never, Never, Never Surrender.</p>

Britain is not a member of the Schengen zone so it is not their problem. I would like to apologise profoundly to the British people and government for French stupidity and arrogance. It is our fault, and our mess. We are really sorry and beg for forgiveness for our folly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Speaking on the live broadcast on France 2 television he also denied that he is accusing the migrant population of &#8220;all evils&#8221; insisting there are issues that have to be addressed.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18591" src="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/migrants-eu_-e1462443279871.jpg" alt="migrants eu" width="640" height="360" /></p>
<p>Mr Sarkozy was reacting to questions from members of the public and specifically discussed the issue of the migrant crisis focusing directly on Africa.</p>
<p>And he said migrants should be transported back to Africa so they can be processed to prevent the clog up and further issues caused by the problems at Calais, but EU regulations prevented such actions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once anyone crosses into the EU border they have the right to stay. This is why millions of people from Africa and the Middle East, South East Asia are coming over. The Schengen zone is also a great place for terrorism to flourish, as well as human trafficking and drug running. Welcome to Europe, please all come to France, you are all welcome mes amis,&#8221; Sarkozy added.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What more reason does Theresa May have to implement Article 50 to complete the mandate of the people of the United Kingdom?</p>
<p>Let us not forget that the majority of people in Britain voted to leave the EU in the EU referendum conducted on June 23 2016.</p>
<p>Since that wonderful day there has only been delaying tactics, and the instatement of Theresa May, a Remain campaigner into office has seen even more delaying tactics.</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s That Article 50 Time</strong></p>
<p>Article 50 must be triggered now. We must trigger Article 50 immediately and there must be no traitorous treachery from the infiltrated crony warehouse: the House of Lords, or from the remaining Remoaners who are predominantly stalwart Marxists.</p>
<p>Trade negotiations will fall into place as they are already doing. As for the Single Market, or what used to be called the Common Market, Britain must reject it because the four tenets required include free movement of people which is unusable with an EU that has <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/357698-france-syria-porous-border/">porous Schengen zone</a> borders, and this is why many people voted to get out of the EU on June 23.</p>
<p><strong>We Must Invoke Article 50 Now</strong></p>
<p>Free movement of people in the EU is a blight on Britain and has filled our streets with beggars, Romanian gypsies and whoever else simply walked into Europe. It has increased the government&#8217;s welfare bill hundredfold, furthermore, the <a href="http://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/staff-cuts-and-a-amp-e-delays-put-hospitals-on-the-brink-jv2b95zcl">NHS </a>is on its last legs and will have to start charging people soon for medical aid.</p>
<p>Britain is full to the brim, and its roads, designed for the horse and cart, are stuck in permanent traffic.</p>
<p>The overcrowded schools where some children have to sit in a class of fifty, and our hospital beds where to get one if you are dying is a luxury, is a disgrace to the tenets of decency.</p>
<p><strong>Article 50</strong></p>
<p>Public transport is a mess especially in London, where people are crammed into carriages coughing and spluttering, the smell of death hangs over the whole transport system.</p>
<p>Overcrowded jobs market, and the jobs, underpriced by migrants and EU grafters who come here, get paid a pittance and send the money home. EU migrants do not benefit Britain as much of their pay is sent immediately to their homelands, as well as their child benefits to their children abroad.</p>
<p><strong>Invoke Article 50 Now</strong></p>
<p>Romanian kingpins and their <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3518736/The-Romanian-town-built-British-benefits-Mansions-bigger-average-UK-semi-BMWs-British-number-plates-parked-drives-paid-taxpayer-cash.html">grotesque mansions</a> are popping up all over the place, all paid for by tax credits and imaginary children. Forged documents are too easy to come by, and these criminals are receiving £5,000 per month from UK benefits.</p>
<p><strong>Did We Mention Article 50?</strong></p>
<p>We must invoke article 50 right now if Britain is to be saved from this dire mess. Do it! Do it now! This is a matter of grave urgency.</p>
<p>Theresa May has to stand by her word to invoke article 50, to get us out of the EU once and for all.</p>
<p>Do it now press the button.</p>
<p><strong>NOW</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sure, people laugh at our stories sometimes, or maybe cry more likely, or just skip to some banal website where one does not have to think, but it is true to say that we predict the future in more ways than one.</p>
<p>Our motto here at the Squib is &#8216;Fuck it&#8217; if it comes into our brains from some heavenly muse it must be okay.</p>
<p>And so when no one was talking about the <a href="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/3212-the-next-step-for-eu-is-to-get-its-own-army.html">EU army</a> in 2012, we were, and no one even considered such a thing to be possible, all the poo pooing is finally coming around. Today&#8217;s <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3789371/Jean-Claude-Juncker-presses-ahead-plans-EU-army-announces-plans-European-military-HQ.html">news </a>that the EU army is being finalised and will be an agitant to Russia, is vindicating but leaves a slight sour taste in one&#8217;s palate.</p>
<p>The Squib may be ignored by all media entities and corporate organisations peddling their shallow lies daily but even though we&#8217;re predominantly satirical we hit the bulls eye more than they do. We like meat and potatoes, and we also like to dig right through to the bone.</p>
<p>If one wishes for a glimpse into the future, satire can be a prophetic tool &#8211; purely because however outlandish some of our stories are, we are living in times where the crazy can indeed come true.</p>
<p>Satire is also a vehicle to convey truth more deeply than any media broadcasting company around today, what they state as fact is usually not the case but some statistic fed to them from a governmental office somewhere with usually skewed results.</p>
<p>There are no algorithms for our brand of satire, and that&#8217;s why we fall foul of the Americanised politically correct companies who have taken over the internet and its operation, naming no names.</p>
<p>As for the Remoaners, it is sort of a shame that we may one day Brexit, because it would have been so nice to see you lot conscripted into Juncker&#8217;s EU army and have your legs blown off at the knee. How much would you like the EU then?</p>
<p>So, we predicted the EU army in 2012. Where&#8217;s our fucking medal? You say there&#8217;s no medal for predictions? Aww..shucks..</p>

<p>If that ain&#8217;t a show of strength what the hell is there? Hillary Clinton kept on going even though she was severely sick, and this is the test of true presidential grit and determination.</p>
<p>If Trump stubs his toe, or even catches a cold he&#8217;s out for the count. Hillary is the real mettle, the real deal and she needs to be applauded for her dedication to office and the United States of America.</p>
<p>America needs strength right now, and it needs strength done in the right way, not wrong way. Hillary is the right person because she has a calculated strength as well as experience in dealing with people in office and on the world stage. Trump knows shit. He is a loudmouth, uncouth jibber jabberer who is all talk and no action, his obese fat body blubbering away while his fat mouth spouts nonsense and truly dumb rhetoric.</p>
<p>You want an adult or a kid as president? Because voting for Trump will get you an irrational psychotic 11-year-old girl as president, but voting for Hillary will get you an adult, who knows how things work, and knows what needs to be done in a cool calculated manner without creating mayhem and total chaos.</p>
<p>You want to live vote Hillary. You want to die vote Trump. He&#8217;ll send your kids over to the Middle East to get their legs blown off. That&#8217;s guaranteed.</p>

<p>The fact that a bunch of Saudi guys who could barely land a Piper training plane controlled extremely complex 767 commercial jets conducting extreme manoeuvres at high speeds that would challenge the most experienced pilots in the world is neither here nor there.</p>
<p>We must also ignore the anomalies present when examining the underside of the grey plane that hit WTC2, those big bulges are certainly not features of any commercial 767 jet.</p>
<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZsP-Gt52P2A" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center>Why stop there, a 767 jet fit into a tiny hole in the Pentagon and punched through four or five layers of concrete and reinforced steel leaving no trace of the wings? There is of course no footage of this event or evidence of a plane.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget the obvious demolition of WTC7, which did not have a scratch on it, or the complete lack of scrambling jet fighters giving a clear run for three &#8216;hijacked&#8217; planes.</p>
<p>The most fantastic part of this escapade a la Northwoods, was the president sitting around reading My Pet Goat. Here was a man notified that America was under attack, but chose to sit in a class and do nothing, except for smirk.</p>
<p>We will sadly never know what happened to the passengers who were supposedly &#8216;hijacked&#8217;.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the operation played out just like the Pearl Harbour event that was needed in the PNAC.</p>
<p>We were soon at war with Iraq and the wonderful War on Terror had begun, or shall we call it the War of Perpetual Terror where our already limited rights were stomped on and erased.</p>
<p>Ah, it&#8217;s September 11 again, a great day to remember, when the beginnings of World War III began, and are continuing to this day, until we get to the real meat and potatoes.</p>

<p>What kind of a president gossips about phone calls with the Russian president in which they reveal that Putin called Obama a n*gger?</p>
<p>Trump is a gossip, a low down blabber mouth and a vulgarian.</p>
<p>It was obvious many months ago that Trump is swimming in waters that are way above his station, but his most recent faux pas is a red stop sign saying no way is this guy going to be president, he is an imbecile with not a single diplomatic bone in his body.</p>
<p>Some people will say &#8216;what you get is what you see&#8217; with Trump, but the role of any politician or premier is exactly the opposite of that.</p>
<p>Donald Trump is a liability, not only to the United States but the globe, and every day we see more utter foolishness from this little man.</p>
<p>It is certain when the debates between Clinton and Trump materialise the evidence will be clearer, on the one hand will be a mature adult, on the other will be an irresponsible kid.</p>
<p>Trump has lost the presidency all by himself, and it is time the people of America woke up to who he really is &#8212; an idiot.</p>

<p>Communities have been blighted in Germany as their towns and villages are taken over by hundreds of thousands of people who harbour deadly terrorists waiting for their time to strike.</p>
<p>The free movement within the Schengen death zone enables these terrorist cells to travel freely within Europe, and to smuggle deadly weapons without any form of checks at borders.</p>
<p>Countries like <a href="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/18583-eu-bends-rules-to-create-visa-free-zone-from-syria-to-english-channel.html">Kosovo</a> where there are vast amounts of unlicensed guns are vying for EU membership and are currently in the fast-track queue.</p>
<p>The Syrian Jihadi cells that have infiltrated Europe through its open door policy are numbered at a moderate 5,000 by <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/12165093/Up-to-5000-Isil-trained-jihadists-could-be-at-large-in-Europe.html">EUROPOL</a>, however if one were to include radicalised homegrown Jihadists, and disenfranchised Muslims within the continent, the  numbers would be well up in the 100,000s.</p>
<p>The well trained terrorists that were invited into the EU merged with migrants. These are battle hardened men and women, trained to blend in, who do not overtly look Islamic, and indulge in alcohol and Western customs. They are triggered by their handlers or news events at any given time, their weapons ready, they can commit attacks within the Schengen zone at any point, and for the European security forces, it is akin to finding a needle in a hay stack.</p>
<p>The role of the attacks on Europe encompass many motives, but the main role is to inculcate a feeling of total fear, the second is to make Muslims living in Europe a pariah, to be hated and feared so much that they will escape to the Middle East and the so-called Caliphate. This within Islamic terms is called the Hijra (migration).</p>
<p>The French seem to have borne the brunt of the attacks in recent months with the Nice attack and numerous others. The Germans have had their fair share, but these are silenced as much as possible by the authorities. Western women are targeted and raped by Islamists, but the worst part of this horror is that EU officials cover up the news and they are not reported by the press.</p>
<p>The only solution is to shut off the Schengen free movement zone completely. All borders must be sealed off if Europe is to be saved from this savagery, however one suspects this will never happen under Merkel and Juncker&#8217;s watch.</p>
<p>It is almost as if they invited terror into Europe willingly and are encouraging the deaths of EU citizens with their actions. Maybe it is so, maybe that is their wish, for they have now created a climate of utter terror and fear in Europe where Muslims are outcasts and lepers to the predominantly Christian population.</p>
<p>If nothing is done soon, there will be all-out war in Europe, civil unrest, and riots where people take it upon themselves to commute justice on those they view as wild savages.</p>
<p>They will keep coming and coming, every day, every minute, more will come, and the next day even more, and there will be no checks, no stops, no order, a constant deluge until Europe is no more.</p>

<p>There should be no more half measures, or shady deals done in back rooms that will effectively keep Britain dangling in a losing EU. We must leave immediately and become decisive.</p>
<p>Does Theresa May have the balls to start proceedings immediately? Probably not, because she technically does not have balls, but we need someone who does have the gumption and balls to do the job effectively.</p>
<p>Bring on John Redwood or Daniel Hannan or Nigel Farage, come forward and repeal the 1972 European Communities Act, we must take back our own constitutional rights to withdraw from the European Union.</p>
<p>Ignoring the pipsqueak Sturgeon, who has no power to do anything without Britain, we must forge ahead as quickly and decisively as possible.</p>
<p>Theresa May, if she wishes to channel Thatcher, must be decisive and strong, to withdraw from the EU immediately so we can take back full control of our laws and trade, we must stop paying Brussels their blood money, we must act with haste and determination.</p>
<p>Do it now.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Out of all Brexiteers, John Redwood has been pretty much the only one who is shouting the loudest when the unjust, undemocratic whining cheating Remain camp or EU come up with another idea to foil Brexit.</p>
<p>Redwood is certainly right in saying that Britons did not vote for a &#8220;slightly beefed-up version&#8221; of David Cameron’s attempted renegotiation with the EU.</p>
<p>He writes: &#8220;We voted to leave, to take back control of our laws, our money and our borders. Those phrases were repeated throughout the Leave campaign, heard and understood by many, and approved by the majority of voters.</p>
<p>&#8220;The rest of the EU is missing the point. There should  be no negotiation over taking back control of these important matters.</p>
<p>&#8220;When the Conservatives lost the 2005 election – partly based on Labour’s lie of no more boom and bust – we did not try to overturn the election result, take them to court, or demand a re-run! We accepted the verdict of the UK voters.&#8221;</p>
<p>Exactamundo! As the Fonz would say.</p>
<p><strong>We voted to Get the Fuck Out of the EU. OUT! GO! GONE! VAMOOSE! AUS!</strong></p>
<p>As for Theresa May saying she wants to &#8216;please everybody&#8217;, that is an impossibility. The majority of the people in the UK voted to LEAVE the EU, and there are going to be some sour faces around but that&#8217;s life, get over it, have a cream soda.</p>
<p>We are now in serious danger of having our democracy violated not only by the EU but the traitorous Remain whiners who don&#8217;t understand democracy. You have a vote, whoever wins wins. That&#8217;s it. You don&#8217;t have another vote just because you lost, that is wrong, that is cheating, that is a violation of democracy.</p>
<p>Remain lost the vote. Get over it. You wanted Britain to stay in some dystopian soviet EU stasi nightmare where even greater union would be foisted on Britain and its sovereignty wiped from the face of the earth. Remain people are deluded, they are willing slaves to the Eurocrats, they are brainwashed idiots each and every one of them, contemptible scum not even worthy of pity.</p>
<p>If there was a state of war right now, all those who voted Remain would be put in camps, because they cannot be trusted, they are nothing but traitors. All their names have been taken.</p>
<p>As for Scotland, yes, they had a 60% Remain vote, but 40% of Scots are not vindictive English hating racists. When the Scots voted for independence they were effectively voting to leave the EU, but funny thing is they did not have a problem with it then. The majority of Scots are bitterly jealous of the English, and they are foisting their own failures as a nation onto voting in referendums. Scotland is blighted by alcoholism, poor diet, unemployment, drugs and a vast hatred for England all rolled into one sickbag of a benefits economy not worth anything. The EU referendum result was the whole United Kingdom voting, and it does not matter that most Scots voted for Remain out of spite, the whole UK emphatically voted to LEAVE the EU.</p>
<p>Brexit means Brexit. Deal with it.</p>

<p>Yes, Michael Gove, the man with the Brexit plan was ousted from government, he was thrown into the political wilderness, otherwise known as the backbenches but where are you now Gove, where are those Brexit dreams seemingly watered down with so much empty rhetoric from the Theresa May coalition of Remainers and Brexiteers?</p>
<p>Come forth O backstabbing brainbox Gove with thou unequivocal computer mind, index the data and tell us what the next fucking step is in the proceedings.</p>
<p>No one else seems to know anything of substance in the current government, it seems as if the dream of Brexit that became a reality for a fleeting moment has once again taken flight as the incessantly moaning Remainers take over the media and eviscerate the dream, waiting for public mood to change.</p>
<p>Gove, your real parents somewhere in the ether, and your adopted parents, all from Scotland, they see you, but don&#8217;t really see you. This Sturgeon, a hater of the English of which you have adopted, wants to spite Britain, she wants to ruin not only Scotland but to Bannockburn the English once and for all.</p>
<p>Rise up from the ashes O mighty erudite Gove, put back on your big round head those glasses and compute the data for us. Bring us out of this malaise so that we can trigger Article 50 and do what is necessary to halt unfettered EU migration yet still keep us in trade.</p>
<p>The traitorous vipers, and greed fuelled lawyers are already out to contest the will of the majority of Britain with legal spanners in the works.</p>
<p>The tawdry Remainers within the government still want to slow things down further, to put obstacles subtly in the way of any negotiation.</p>

<p>Although there is a news blackout in Munich, a right wing team of operative/s have gone on a shooting spree at a shopping zone.</p>
<p>Ten people have been shot and killed, and the indications point to a right wing neo-nazi operation targeting Muslims and Turks in Germany after shouting to onlookers that he was German. Further information reveals the attacker was of German-Iranian descent which suggests he was a provocateur shouting disinformation.</p>
<p><strong>Munich Massacre</strong></p>
<p>Due to the migratory pressures in the country over the last few years, and the open door policy espoused by Chancellor Merkel, there has been much hatred of migrants in Germany.</p>
<p>There is a lot of pressure within Europe right now, on one level there are an estimated 5,000 Jihadi cells who came into the continent freely through the Schengen zone according to <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3455254/There-5-000-ISIS-trained-jihadists-roaming-large-European-Union-warns-head-Interpol.html">EUROPOL</a>, and on the other side, homegrown people who follow right wing nationalistic traits wishing to commit terror atrocities on migrants.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE: German authorities have finally released some information on the attacker who is believed to be an Iranian born in Germany. </strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Republican National Convention Dysfunction</em></p>
<p>On the left were the Young Turks, and on the right Alex Jones.</p>
<p>These two so-called media establishments are American staples in low quality trigger politics, and in Alex Jones&#8217; case conspiracy provocation. Americans thrive on the lowest common denominator of shouting the news. For a population of predominantly low IQ idiots, this is the height of intelligent discourse.</p>
<p><strong>Baiting</strong></p>
<p>The well orchestrated attack by the Infowars Jones team was captured on camera and is thoroughly entertaining.</p>
<p>In tow were the ladies, on the left Ana Kasparian wearing a red dress, and Infowars favourite Lee Ann Mcadoo. To see them hurling insults at each other certainly added a sensation in the underpants, especially with the sexy Ana and Lee Ann. One would have wished for them to suddenly jump at each other and tear their clothes off in wild abandon. Unfortunately, that never happened.</p>
<p>There were no punches thrown although at one point it looked close.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_m-42A37zxM" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Fighting over ratings and viewership is a staple pastime amongst these two rivals, and it is a pity they do not put more time into improving the quality of their shows.</p>
<p>Infowars is basically a lowly news aggregator much like the thieving Drudge Report, and the Young Turks is an opinion based aggregator where they comment on any given story mostly garnering YT <a href="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/TYT-1-1.png">hits</a> from sex related stories. None of them create their own work. None of them are creative individuals but are senseless egotistical American banal thugs peddling other peoples work and making it their own in a shouty lowly way.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em><b>A news aggregator</b>, also termed a <b>feed aggregator</b>, <b>feed</b> reader, <b>news</b> reader, RSS reader or simply <b>aggregator</b>, is client software or a web application which aggregates syndicated web content such as online newspapers, blogs, podcasts, and video blogs (vlogs) in one location.</em></p>
<p>When I say thugs, I mean these people are uncouth thieves of other peoples reportage. They take and do not give. Granted they make a very good living out of what they do, because the American people have no standards when it comes to media and accept any old detritus.</p>
<p>Sell enough shit, and people eventually like shit. They do not know the difference.</p>
<p>Well, the thuggery worked, they got people talking about them, and their ratings may have another boost, and their advertisers will like that.</p>
<p>Bravo!</p>

<p>&#8220;If you wish to die then vote Trump. When it comes to the election, you or your children may very well be called up to the army. When you land in Arabia or some other godforsaken land you will most probably die in a hail of bullets, or have your limbs blown from your body. This is war, and you will be doing it at Trump&#8217;s behest,&#8221; a military adviser at the Republican party headquarters revealed on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Much like George W. Bush, there will be no qualms in entering into wars in the Middle East, with troops on the ground and dead Americans piling up the morgues.</p>
<p>Trump&#8217;s already had council with Kissinger, and this was a precursor to war in itself. War under Trump is a guaranteed ideal.</p>
<p>Such is the support for Trump that many Americans are willing to die for him, and his demagogue status.</p>
<p>Dick Monroe, 41, from Chicago, Illinois said at a recent Trump rally: &#8220;I want to die for Trump and the flag. It&#8217;s an honour to have my legs blown off at the knee, as long as I know I am working for America&#8217;s corporate interests abroad.&#8221;</p>
<p>Who is to say that Trump won&#8217;t trigger a full scale nuclear war with N. Korea, Iran, Russia or China, because if he does that, not only will most of America die, but so will most of Western Europe and Australia. The thought of having someone who is trigger happy and unhinged with their finger on the red button is unsavoury, however an all out nuclear war resulting in a nuclear winter for fifty years could be a good thing in the long run, because it will give the earth time to recover from the human polluting pestilence.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s to Trump. Vote for him if you and your children, grandchildren, family wish to die.</p>

<p><span class="st">Erdoğan</span>, however wishes to turn the clock back and reintroduce the Ottoman Turkish script which is a derivative of Arabic and Persian.</p>

<p>Despite the fear inducing projections of the likes of Soros, it is a certainty that the EU will continue to function post-Brexit, and Britain will continue to work with the EU and the rest of the global community in peace.</p>
<p>The markets will stabilise as there has been little fundamental change to the status of Britain, and Brussels has reacted relatively calmly to the EU referendum result. Germany&#8217;s Chancellor Merkel gave a positive, calm <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-wrapup-idUSKCN0ZB090">speech</a> on Saturday.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">&#8220;Quite honestly, it should not take ages, that is true, but I would not fight now for a short time frame,&#8221; Merkel told a news conference.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">&#8220;The negotiations must take place in a businesslike, good climate,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Britain will remain a close partner, with which we are linked economically.&#8221;</p>
<p>Retaining a strong Great Britain within International politics will bolster the alliance between the United States and the European Union as well as their allies in Eastern Asia.</p>
<p>Britain has the fifth largest economy in the world, holds seats in the United Nations security council and is a key member of NATO.</p>
<p>Britain&#8217;s contribution to geo-political discourse and proliferation are invaluable to global political peace, especially in this time of unrest in the Middle East.</p>
<p>As well as forging new trading deals with emerging economies across the globe, the UK will prosper once again as it enjoys its place at the head of the financial global centre. There is no doubt that Brexit was a feared outcome from the globalists, however their fear should subside with time as global stability is reassured.</p>
<p>There are many nations like Japan, Canada, Australia who are flourishing outside the European Union with trade deals, and peaceful cooperation with other nations. Britain is one of these nations, and the democratic EU referendum conducted on June 23, 2016 proved that there is a plan to forge its own path in the global community, yet still contribute and cooperate fully within the globalised world. Britain does not think in terms of restricted trade with punishing EU regulations within an inward looking EU, it instead chooses to look globally to a market of 7 billion people.</p>
<p>The global plan is still intact, and will indeed strengthen, as to have a strong Great Britain outside the EU is better than to have a weakened Great Britain within the EU.</p>

<li><strong>A referendum in Gibraltar in 2002 demonstrated that 99% of residents were in favour of the continuation of British rule.</strong></li>
<li><strong>In 2013 the British Government gave the following statement: &#8220;The Prime Minister has made clear that the UK government will meet its constitutional commitments to the people of Gibraltar and will not compromise on sovereignty&#8221;.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Bow Group calls for the Foreign Secretary to withdraw and clarify the comments, or resign alongside other members of the government who cannot support the EU referendum result.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Andrew Rosindell MP describes the Foreign Secretaries comments as &#8220;hysterical&#8221;. </strong></li>
</ul>

<p dir="ltr"><strong> </strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Bow Group Chairman Ben Harris-Quinney said:</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;I have worked closely with members of the Spanish government and Partido Poplar, and have been proud to do so, but the people of Gibraltar have indicated their very clear desire that Gibraltar should remain British and that must be respected by the British and Spanish governments alike.</p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary should be doing everything he can to support and defend our territories, his statement today has caused great concern in Gibraltar and Britain, and cast doubt over the future of Gibraltar&#8217;s status during a time of uncertainty.</p>
<p>Phillip Hammond must clarify and withdraw his statements. If he and other &#8220;Remain&#8221; supporting Ministers are not willing to fulfil their duty with Britain now leaving the EU, they must resign with immediate effect.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>On learning of the Foreign Secretary&#8217;s statement this afternoon, long term campaigner for Gibraltar&#8217;s British status Andrew Rosindell MP said:</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Gibraltar is British and will be protected &amp; kept safe no matter what. It is hysterical to suggest otherwise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the 23rd June 2016, the people of the United Kingdom collectively voted to get out of the EU.</p>
<p>Since the results unanimously proclaimed a win for the Leave side, the Remain campaign has not halted their campaign, and Project Fear is an ongoing mission amongst the IN campaigners.</p>
<p>Sore losers to a democratic referendum, the remain camp is doing everything in its power to destabilise an already unstable post-Brexit situation by disseminating scare stories and disinformation.</p>
<p>This is wrong, and should be stopped. Remain lost fair and square and should accept the result from the British people.</p>
<p>Even George Osborne, came out of hiding and today gave a positive Brexit speech revealing contingency plans for the country and economy.</p>
<p>Boris Johnson, who is the key contender to head a post-Brexit government, gave a speech this morning detailing plans for moving Britain forward in the next few months.</p>
<section class="text-description">
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">&#8220;There will still be intense and intensifying European cooperation and partnership in a huge number of fields: the arts, the sciences, the universities, and on improving the environment.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">&#8220;EU citizens living in this country will have their rights fully protected, and the same goes for British citizens living in the EU.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">&#8220;British people will still be able to go and work in the EU; to live; to travel; to study; to buy homes and to settle down. As the German equivalent of the CBI &#8211; the BDI &#8211; has very sensibly reminded us, there will continue to be free trade, and access to the single market.&#8221;</p>
</section>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">&#8220;The only change &#8211; and it will not come in any great rush &#8211; is that the UK will extricate itself from the EU&#8217;s extraordinary and opaque system of legislation: the vast and growing corpus of law enacted by a European Court of Justice from which there can be no appeal.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">&#8220;This will bring not threats, but golden opportunities for this country &#8211; to pass laws and set taxes according to the needs of the UK.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">&#8220;Yes, the Government will be able to take back democratic control of immigration policy, with a balanced and humane points-based system to suit the needs of business and industry.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">&#8220;Yes, there will be a substantial sum of money which we will no longer send to Brussels, but which could be used on priorities such as the NHS. Yes, we will be able to do free trade deals with the growth economies of the world in a way that is currently forbidden.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is nothing to fear. Britain will conduct its business in good time, and the markets have been calmed.</p>
<p>If you are a Remain campaigner, please get over yourself, you must accept the result that was democratically voted by the British people.</p>
<p>Brexit is a fundamentally outward looking project. It does not seek to isolate Britain from Europe, or the world, and now is the time to embrace it for all parties.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SNP leader said she would order her MSPs to refuse &#8220;legislative consent&#8221; if and when when the Scottish Parliament was required to ratify the UK&#8217;s withdrawal from the bloc.</p>
<p>Speaking to the BBC she <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-36633244">said</a>: &#8220;If the Scottish Parliament was judging this on the basis of what&#8217;s right for Scotland then the option of saying look we&#8217;re not to vote for something that&#8217;s against Scotland&#8217;s interest, of course that&#8217;s got to be on the table.&#8221;</p>
<p>The further threats and nasty rhetoric from Sturgeon comes after threatening to hold another vote of Independence from England and Wales on Friday.</p>
<p>These Scottish threats are bitter convulsions and vindictive undemocratic rejections of democratic freedom for the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>The European Commission, the executive body of the EU, has already ruled there is no option but the whole of the UK exiting following Thursday&#8217;s Leave vote, putting Sturgeon&#8217;s threats to ground.</p>
<p>Vote Leave&#8217;s Theresa Villiers has <a href="http://metro.co.uk/2016/06/26/sorry-folks-but-scotland-cant-block-brexit-5967845/">rejected </a>the ludicrous claims from Sturgeon and revealed that parliament has the last say on the matter.</p>
<p>Question. Why on earth would anyone vote for independence to gain their supposed &#8216;freedom&#8217; only to join an undemocratic EU? It makes no logical sense. The only explanation is a deep seated racist hatred of the English fuelling this odd behaviour.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Comrades! Citizens! Brothers and Sisters! Men, women, gender fluids of our Soviet Labour Party!</p>
<p>I am addressing you, my friends!</p>
<p>The perfidious coup attack on our Party, begun on June 24 by lickspittle traitor Commissar Hilary, is continuing.</p>
<p>In spite of heroic resistance of the Labourite Red Army, and although the enemy’s finest divisions and finest units have already been smashed and have met their doom on the field of battle, the enemy continues to push forward, hurling fresh forces into the attack.</p>
<p>Hilary&#8217;s troops have succeeded in capturing half of the shadow cabinet, a considerable part of the Cabinet, but we have upped the barricades and thrown the enemy from the ramparts.</p>
<p>The Fascist coup is extending the range of operations of its attacks and is bombing the news media with further lies, lies, lies.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13774" src="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Comrade-Corbyn-labour.jpg" alt="Comrade Corbyn labour" width="360" height="237" srcset="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Comrade-Corbyn-labour.jpg 360w, http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Comrade-Corbyn-labour-300x198.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>A grave danger hangs over our party.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>How could it have happened that our glorious Red Army surrendered a number of Cabinet seats to the Fascist traitors and vile betrayers of our Soviet ideals?</p>
<p>What is required to put an end to the danger hovering over our party, and what measures must be taken to smash the enemy?</p>
<p>Above all, it is essential that our people, the Soviet Labour party, should understand the full immensity of the danger that threatens our party and abandon all complacency, all heedlessness, all those moods of peaceful, constructive work which were so natural before the coup but which are fatal today when the in-fighting has fundamentally changed everything.</p>
<p>The enemy is cruel and implacable. He is out to seize our party watered with our sweat, to seize our soviet Marxist ideology and soil secured by our hard work.</p>
<p>He is out to restore the rule of landlords, to restore capitalism, to destroy national culture and the national State socialist existence of Soviet Britons.</p>
<p>Thus the issue is one of life or death for the Soviet Labour party, for the peoples of Britain.: the issue is whether peoples of the Soviet Labour Peoples Party shall remain enslaved or fall into democracy.</p>
<p>The Soviet people must realise this and abandon all heedlessness, they must mobilise themselves and reorganise all their work on new, wartime lines, when there can be no mercy to the enemy.</p>
<p>Further, there must be no room in our ranks for whimperers and cowards, for panic-mongers and deserters; our people must know no fear in the fight and must selflessly join our patriotic War of liberation, our war against the democratic enslavers.</p>
<p>MacDonald, the great founder of our Party, used to say that the chief virtue of the Soviet people must be courage, valour, fearlessness in struggle, readiness to fight together with the people against the enemies of our party.</p>
<p>We must wage a ruthless fight against all disorganisers of the rear, deserters, panic-mongers, rumour-mongers, exterminate spies, diversionists, enemy parachutists, rendering rapid aid in all this to our destroyer battalions. We must bear in mind that the enemy is crafty, unscrupulous, experienced in deception and dissemination of false rumours.</p>
<p>We must reckon with all this and not fall victim to provocation. All who by their panic-mongering and cowardice hinder the work of defence, no matter who they are, must be immediately haled before a party tribunal.</p>
<p>In order to insure a rapid mobilisation of all forces of the peoples of the Soviet Labour Party, and to repulse the interior enemy who treacherously attacked our party, a State Committee of Defence has been formed in whose hands the entire power of the State has been vested.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>All our forces for the support of our heroic Red Army and our glorious Labour Party!</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>All the forces of the people&#8212;for the demolition of the enemy!</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Forward, to our victory!</p></blockquote>

<p>Through Britain&#8217;s education system, from primary to university, students are conditioned over the years in <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/unitedkingdom/education/eu-teaching-materials_en">EU programs</a> and ideology of Marxist collectivisation.</p>

We can see the strength and level of programming that brainwashed the young from some of their reaction during the EU referendum where many did not know why they were pro-EU but found themselves uncontrollably waving the EU flag at every opportunity. In most cases, the brainwashing was so powerful that the youth were not aware of what they were doing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This EU referendum has been more about England and Wales Versus Ireland and Scotland as demonstrated by the voting pattern. With the Scots voting overwhelmingly in favour of the EU, the SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon is now citing this as a reason to hold a second Scottish referendum, thus leading to the breakup of the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>According to the Edinburgh Agreement of 2014, the Scottish referendum was a once in a generation legally bound opportunity for Scotland to break away from the UK. They chose not to do so by 55.3% once the referendum was held on 18 September 2014. The EU referendum result is nothing to do with the SNP manifesto, and Sturgeon&#8217;s threats are not legally sound.</p>
<p>The SNP have <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/snp-loses-overall-majority-in-scottish-parliament-a7016131.html">lost </a>their majority in the Scottish parliament, and any move to split the UK up would be contested heavily.</p>
<p>Oil revenues have dropped by 94% with the price of oil at a now perpetual low which will not rise any time soon. Revenue from North Sea Oil from 2015/16 – <a href="http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/14102424.SNP_criticised_after_slump_in_oil_revenues_to___130m_forecast/?ref=mc&amp;lp=2">fell </a>to £130 million. That is a drop from the £2.2 billion of the previous year.</p>
<p>Due to a decreasing revenue stream Scotland relies solely on the UK paying them money to keep afloat as the majority of the Scottish population are not able to pay taxes. The UK pays Scotland through the Barnett Formula £15 Billion over the amount that is raised by their taxes just to keep their public services afloat. Therefore, Scotland relies on England just to keep it afloat, especially with oil revenues at such a low level.</p>
<p>If Scotland wanted to leave, they would not only lose the UK handouts which amount to 15% of GDP, but they would not be granted use of the Pound Sterling.</p>
<p>Regarding currency, if Scotland wishes to join the EU, they would have to adopt the euro currency, additionally Scotland will have to pay Brussels £1.5 Billion per annum as is required by every member state.</p>
<p>If Nicola Sturgeon is willing to increase taxation on Scots by 65% to accommodate a 15% loss in GDP and a £1.5 Billion EU charge, she should not consider her vindictive knee-jerk move for a second Scottish Independence Referendum which will make her country poorer than it already is.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today was a historic moment that your children will remember, they will tell their children, and their grandchildren, and their children&#8217;s children.</p>
<p>It was the day democracy came back to Europe.</p>
<p>The road to a place where the firmament of justice and democracy lies is not paved with gold, but it is paved with hardship, with thorns and it is perilous, but it is the right path to take, and the British people chose this path over the undemocratic easy EU path where Britain would have become a subservient slave to other masters.</p>
<p>To forge your own path in life, embodies courage, honour and guts. Bravery of immense proportions was displayed at the EU referendum polls last night, as Britain broke free from an entity that eviscerates nations, and in a calculated nature condemns countries to a future of conformity and allegiance to unelected Eurocrats.</p>
<p>Yes, the EU will survive Britain leaving, but it will be an EU made up of sclerotic stuttering countries, most in vast debt, unemployment, unable to solve their economic circumstances because of restrictive EU regulations and economic curbs. Most importantly, the EU through its malevolent obstinate unwillingness to reform has resulted in Britain leaving, a nation that is truly the head of Europe, not only geographically but historically, economically, militarily and culturally.</p>
<p>No doubt, we will still get nil point at the insipid, politically motivated Eurovision song contest, if it is even held next year, although not many care, but our legacy has been about bringing forth a real democratic force back to the European continent so all of that other dross does not matter any more.</p>
<p><strong>Democracy</strong></p>
<p>This is a dawn of a new era, where Britain will regain its voice once again, taking back the reins of its own destiny.</p>
<p>The guileless protestations of the youthful naive Europhiles on the likes of twitter, are merely that. These people did not know how the EU really operated, they did not know of the machinations of the EU behemoth, and were brainwashed, comprehensively tricked by the likes of Cameron and his ministries of disinformation. Such was the inclusive brainwashing of some of these people that they actually believed &#8216;we are stronger IN&#8217; within some Borg-like EU cube of multiple regulatory undemocratic restrictive gravy train driven soviet enslavement.</p>
<p>Those brainwashed citizens have now been educated in democracy, and let us hope they learn their lesson well, and break free from their mind-altered EU hypnosis. To awaken from their state may be quite a shock, but it is a good shock to the system.</p>
<p>The chief architects of this British EU misery were Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, Peter Mandelson, David Cameron and George Osborne. Their evil plan failed. They were scuppered by the Brexit campaign, democracy, and ultimately the people.</p>
<p>Today, you can walk the fields of England with your head held high, and know you are a free man or woman. You can be proud that Britain stood up for what it believed in, for freedom from tyranny, totalitarian rule, undemocratic restrictive laws, and that awful circular starred flag where each star depicts a death of a nation. Soon that flag will have one less star, and that loss will symbolise the rebirth of a nation from the ashes of EU servitude.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>STATEMENT BY BORIS JOHNSON ON IMMIGRATION STATISTICS</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last year, 270,000 people came to this country from the EU and net migration was 184,000. That means we are adding a population the size of Oxford to the UK every year just from EU migration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since 2004, 1.25 million people have been added to the population due to EU migration. That is bigger than the city of Birmingham.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always championed the great benefits that can come from immigration. I am the proud descendant of immigrants.I&#8217;ve seen how as Mayor of a great capital city, London has benefited in so many ways from migration. As Mayor I argued consistently for a more sensible visa policy that would welcome talented people from across the globe, people recruited on the basis of their skills.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Britain benefits from cultural influences from abroad, I&#8217;m pro-immigration, but above all I&#8217;m pro controlled immigration. People of all races and backgrounds in the UK are genuinely concerned about uncontrolled immigration and the pressure it&#8217;s placing on local services. People have every right to question why we can&#8217;t control our borders. We need to answer those concerns by taking back control of those borders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But we must also face the fact that the system has spun out of control. We cannot control the numbers. We cannot control the terms on which people come and how we remove those who abuse our hospitality. This puts huge pressure on schools, hospitals and housing. It is exploited by some big companies that use immigration to keep wages down &#8211; and it is striking that the pay packets of FTSE 100 chief executives are now 150 times the average pay of people in their firms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Worst of all, it is terrible for our democracy. People have watched Prime Minister after Prime Minister make promises on immigration that cannot be met because of the EU and this has deeply damaged faith in our democratic system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Prime Minister repeatedly promised that he would get a grip of this. The government told us that it would &#8216;keep our ambition of delivering annual net migration in the tens of thousands&#8217;. We were told that economic migrants from the EU would need to prove they had a job offer to come here &#8211; a pledge made by the Prime Minister, the Home Secretary and the Chancellor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am afraid that Brussels sent them packing, and in fact 77,000 have come since the Prime Minister made that promise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Government has failed because of the simple reality that inside the EU we cannot control immigration &#8211; it is literally impossible because we have no choice but to accept the principle of free movement and the European Court has ultimate control over our immigration policy. This has led to the absurd situation in which we stop highly qualified people coming from around the world who could contribute enormously to our society because we cannot stop millions of unskilled people coming here from the EU.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even worse, the Prime Minister&#8217;s deal has given away control of immigration and asylum forever. His deal does nothing to solve this crisis and has not brought back a single power for the UK. The rogue European Court now controls not just immigration policy but how we implement asylum policy under the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And, on top of all of this, new countries are in the queue to join the EU and the EU is extending visa-free travel to the border of Syria and Iraq. It is mad.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you vote IN on 23 June, you are kissing goodbye permanently to control of immigration. You are voting for the current situation not only to continue but to get worse. You are voting for the European Court to be in charge of immigration and asylum policy permanently. You are giving away any chance of democratic legitimacy for immigration policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only way to take back control of immigration is to Vote Leave on 23 June. The public should be able to vote for those who make the laws of this country including on immigration. It is intolerable to continue without democratic consent for Britain&#8217;s immigration policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That will be best for our public services, particularly the NHS. It will also allow us to have a fairer immigration system that is better for Britain, stops discriminating on the basis of where you come from, and instead allows us to pick people on the basis of skills.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Imagine how much stronger we will be, and how much more respected in the world, when we have an immigration policy that stops discriminating on the basis of whether you are an EU citizen and instead selects people on the basis of their contribution to this country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The British public support immigration but they want it controlled by those who they elect. They are generous but feel their generosity has been abused. They are right. On the 23 June they will get their chance to take back control.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>That&#8217;s the safer choice.</strong></p>

<p><b>The Prime Minister has categorically failed to reduce net migration to the tens of thousands as he repeatedly promised.</b></p>

<p>In his <a href="http://press.conservatives.com/post/98882674910/david-cameron-speech-to-conservative-party" target="_blank">2014 conference speech</a>, Cameron described: &#8216;Numbers that have increased faster than we in this country wanted at a level that was too much for our communities, for our labour markets. All of this has to change – and it will be at the very heart of my renegotiation strategy for Europe. Britain, I know you want this sorted so I will go to Brussels, I will not take no for an answer and when it comes to free movement – I will get what Britain needs&#8217;.</p>
<p>The 2015 Conservative Manifesto stated the Government would &#8216;keep our ambition of delivering <a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/manifesto2015/ConservativeManifesto2015.pdf#page=31" target="_blank">annual net migration</a> in the tens of thousands&#8217;.</p>
<p>In her speech to the 2015 Conservative Party conference in Manchester, the Home Secretary, <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/theresa-may-s-speech-to-the-conservative-party-conference-in-full-a6681901.html" target="_blank">Theresa May</a>, said: &#8216;not all of the consequences can be managed, and doing so for many of them comes at a high price&#8230; But even if we could manage all the consequences of mass immigration, Britain does not need net migration in the hundreds of thousands every year&#8230; The evidence – from the OECD, the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee and many academics – shows that while there are benefits of selective and controlled immigration, at best the net economic and fiscal effect of high immigration is close to zero.  So there is no case, in the national interest, for immigration of the scale we have experienced over the last decade. Neither is it true that, in the modern world, immigration is no longer possible to control&#8230; The numbers coming from Europe are unsustainable and the rules have to change&#8217;.</p>

<p><b>The Prime Minister, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Home Secretary promised EU migrants should have to have a job offer to come to the UK.</b></p>
<p>In November 2014, the Prime Minister, David Cameron, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/jcb-staffordshire-prime-ministers-speech" target="_blank">promised</a> that &#8216;we want EU jobseekers to have a job offer before they come here&#8230; So let&#8217;s be clear what all these changes taken together will mean. EU migrants should have a job offer before they come here&#8217;.</p>
<p>The Chancellor of the Exchequer, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/03/george-osborne-downplays-difference-germany-eu-freedom-movement" target="_blank">George Osborne</a>, has said: &#8216;What we&#8217;re going to address is this question of how freedom of movement operates in the 21st century. It was never envisaged that you would have such large numbers of people coming, people coming who don&#8217;t have job offers&#8217;.</p>
<p>The Home Secretary, <a href="http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/world_news/article1600014.ece" target="_blank">Theresa May</a>, has argued: &#8216;when it was first enshrined, free movement meant the freedom to move to a job, not the freedom to cross borders to look for work&#8230; we must take some big decisions, face down powerful interests and reinstate the original principle underlying free movement within the EU&#8217;.</p>

<p><b>The Prime Minister did not even ask for this as part of the renegotiation as it was illegal under EU law.</b></p>
<p>The renegotiation agreement notes that EU citizens are &#8216;<a href="http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-1-2016-INIT/en/pdf#page=22" target="_blank">entitled to reside&#8230; [in the UK] solely because of their job-search</a>&#8216;.</p>
<p>The demand that EU migrants must have a job offer was <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/475679/Donald_Tusk_letter.pdf" target="_blank">not contained</a> in the Prime Minister&#8217;s letter to Donald Tusk of November 2015 or his Chatham House speech of the same day.</p>
<p>This is because it is illegal under EU law. As early as 1991, the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A61989CJ0292" target="_blank">European Court</a> held that the &#8216;Treaty entails the right for nationals of Member States to move freely within the territory of the other Member States and to stay there for the purposes of seeking employment&#8217;.</p>

<p>The main reason for the French denial of terrorism is an obvious one, as the authorities would not want to be blamed for their porous security risk ridden system within the Schengen zone, especially when there is an EU referendum occurring in Britain.</p>
<p><strong>MS804</strong></p>
<p>The EU&#8217;s Schengen zone is a gift to terrorism, especially for groups like ISIS. Within the Schengen zone, terrorist groups can easily move arms, bombs and other materials designed to cause maximum civilian damage around EU countries. The utopian dream of a Schengen zone can only be a viable solution during a time of global peace, of which we have none at the moment.</p>
<p>The lax security measures at French airports are ideal for terrorists to exploit, and this is why you are putting your life at risk simply from entering an airport in France or Brussels.</p>
<p>After the <a href="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/17874-brussels-attack-schengen-directly-responsible.html">Brussels airport bomb attack</a> little or no measures were implemented to resolve serious security flaws, and this will continue as long as there is a Schengen zone in place.</p>
<p>Britain must vote leave on June 23 to take back control of our borders, to ensure our citizens are safe, and to stay as far away from the dangerous, irresponsible Schengen zone as possible whilst the world is in such turmoil.</p>

<p>Naturally, London has borne the brunt of the deluge, but this is not over, if Britain remains in the EU, the numbers will exceed 4 million extra inhabitants within a decade.</p>
<p>If Britons see sense, and Vote to Leave, there will be respite, as the borders will finally come under some form of control.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/internationalmigration/bulletins/migrationstatisticsquarterlyreport/may2016" target="_blank">ONS</a> today released figures that reiterate this urgency to take back control. David Cameron has failed in his pledge to reduce migration and if we remain in the EU it will get a lot worse as Britain will have no say in the levels coming into the UK. Net migration from the EU rose from 174,000 in 2014 to 184,000 last year.</p>
<p>Remaining in the EU, will condemn London to grow to a staggering 10-12 million, rendering it a wreck akin to some favela ridden South American city.</p>
<p>The previously protected green belt and much loved parks will be a thing of the past, concreted over forever to build tower blocks for EU migrants.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18585" src="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/2-e1462442146725.jpg" alt="Schengen mass migration" width="640" height="427" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Schengen zone, gives access to the UK, as anyone who enters the zone only has to wait to get their EU papers before they make their way to the free healthcare utopia that is Britain. The current population of the EU is 508, 000, 000 but that number will increase exponentially as the wars in the Middle East grind on and other nations like Turkey are added.</p>
<p>Britain is only 80,823 sq miles and there is no more room left. The schools are overcrowded messes, with some classes having 40-50 children per teacher, the NHS is crumbling with the deluge with hospital beds in corridors and medicine shortages, the roads are gridlocked, the housing shortage is punishing working Britons whose only crime was being born on a tiny island, there is no hope for Britain if it stays in the EU. There is no hope for your children, or their children.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18428" src="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/nhs.jpg" alt="nhs corridor" width="620" height="349" srcset="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/nhs-300x169.jpg 300w, http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/nhs-600x338.jpg 600w, http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/nhs.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></p>
<p>The hopelessness can only be alleviated by change. Stand up and vote to leave. It does not have to be this way, you do not have to follow David Cameron blindly or digest the propaganda being spewed from the BBC and other media on a constant basis.</p>
<p><strong>Take Back Control</strong></p>
<p>We can change this. There are alternatives to what we have now, and we can move forward to give Britain some space. We need space to grow, we need space for our children to play, we need space on our roads so we can drive, we need space for the sake of having space.</p>
<p>There is an alternative, there always was an alternative to what the mainstream message is always trying to indoctrinate the masses with. You can make a difference by voting to leave this EU corrupt mess. You can put an X on Vote Leave and get Britain out of this awful turmoil, this tyranny that has been foisted on us by stealth. This is not about race, xenophobia or any other construct, this is about space.</p>
<p>Let us open up Britain globally, through trade, through selective migration, through our sheer will we can save Britain from the deluge that will render us irrelevant if we don&#8217;t do something now.</p>
<p>David Cameron has seen fit to destroy Britain, once it is gone, it will be gone forever. There will be no other chance. This is it.</p>
<p>Vote Leave on June 23 is the only choice that a Briton should make, it is the only logical choice to take back control from the faceless unelected eurocrats who do not know who you are, they do not care who you are, and they certainly do not want to ever know who you are.</p>
<p>Save Britain. It is Your duty.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>New research by Vote Leave shows that:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">EU public procurement law imposes extremely onerous requirements on public authorities, which can apply regardless of the value of a contract and/or whether any tenderers are from outside the UK. The Government pledged to change this, but EU procurement law remains unaffected by the renegotiation.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">EU public procurement law imposes an annual cost of at least <strong>£1.69 billion</strong> to the taxpayer. This is five times what is spent on the NHS Cancer Drugs Fund, 34 times what is spent on the Government&#8217;s dedicated Pothole Action Fund, or enough to pay for 273,000 basic state pensions.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Between 2010 and 2014, EU public procurement legislation imposed costs of at least <strong>£8.4 billion</strong> in real terms on the taxpayer. This is three times what will be spent on flood defences in England between 2015 and 2021, six times the cost of the new Queensferry Crossing in Scotland, or enough to build 25 new hospitals.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Delays to projects caused by EU public procurement law amounted to <strong>5,422 years</strong> in 2014 alone. Procurement legislation delayed the award of contracts between 2010 and 2014 by <strong>27,912 years</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Commenting, Michael Gove MP said:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8216;If we Vote Leave we can scrap the EU&#8217;s foolish rules on how Whitehall runs procurement processes which add billions to the cost of Government every year. I&#8217;ve experienced firsthand in the Department for Education how these rules add significant operational costs and generate expensive delays to construction projects. Across Whitehall, there are billions to save after we Vote Leave.&#8217;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Commenting, Vote Leave Chief Executive Matthew Elliott, said:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8216;The EU already costs us a fortune thanks to our £350 million a week contribution to the EU budget, but the hidden costs of membership are compounding the bill to British taxpayers. Pernicious interference from Brussels not only stifles business, it makes government more bureaucratic and less responsive. The PM&#8217;s closest adviser has said EU membership makes Britain ungovernable while sixty per cent of our laws now come from Brussels. The only way to take back control is to Vote Leave on 23 June.&#8217;</p>

<p>Trump said he could go to Fifth Avenue and unload a gun into a crowd and still not have his ratings drop? He&#8217;s the Teflon Don, nothing sticks to this guy.</p>
<p>That is until now&#8230;maybe.</p>
<p>Allegations have surfaced that tie trump to a <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/25/exclusive-donald-trump-signed-off-deal-designed-to-deprive-us-of/" target="_blank">multimillion dollar tax fraud</a> where the US tax office was denied millions of dollars during a dodgy deal with Icelandic firm FL Group.</p>
<p>This action of disguising equity as a loan deal is fraudulent and cheated the IRS out of $100 million.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em>Julius Schwarz, Bayrock&#8217;s executive vice president</em>: &#8220;Call it equity but for tax purposes its debt. Otherwise we write a huge check to the IRS. As a 49 per cent equity partner they are still equity. There is no other way around it.”</p>
<p>Whether Trump would be directly liable for such a crime is a question that only lawyers can answer, and whether the IRS ever get off their asses and actually do something about this is another matter.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2838620-Trumpdoc2.html#document/p1" rel="attachment wp-att-19053"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19053" src="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/trump-fraud.jpg" alt="trump fraud" width="400" height="283" srcset="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/trump-fraud-300x212.jpg 300w, http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/trump-fraud.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a></p>
<p>Our feeling is the Teflon Don is going to skate through this obvious attack by either ignoring it, or denying it, despite his signature on the papers. Naturally, Drudge is ignoring this story as well.</p>
<p>A question of judgement? Is Trump president material when he seems to have his fingerprints all over a multimillion dollar fraud? Doubt we&#8217;ll ever know as this, like everything else is merely water off a ducks back for the Teflon Don.</p>

<p>The EU wide taxpayer identification number (TIN) is planned to be implemented soon within the next year.</p>
<p>&#8216;Properly identifying taxpayers is essential to the fight against fraud and evasion. A new web portal allows tax officials, and businesses involved in cross-border transactions, to check the structure of unique taxpayer identification numbers (TINs). These are <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/taxation/tax_cooperation/mutual_assistance/tin/index_en.htm">tax identification numbers</a> that EU countries allocate to their own taxpayers. The portal also provides useful samples of official identity documents containing national TINs. The Commission consulted on whether to move towards creating a single, unique <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/common/consultations/tax/2013_eutin_en.htm">EU-wide TIN</a>.&#8217;</p>
<p>The EU Tax authority will have the power to access bank account data for every single citizen in the EU and even extract money from an account for taxation reasons.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://edcab.eu/blog/vote-to-adopt-eu-virtual-currencies-and-blockchain-report-passed" target="_blank">EU Monetary Affairs Committee</a> is also cracking down on digital currencies by implementing new regulations that will halt the freedom of use of crypto-currencies within the EU. According to the Commission, the measures will &#8216;bring virtual currency exchange platforms under the scope of the existing Anti-Money Laundering Directive which is due for an update.&#8217;</p>
<p>The report also calls for the EU to take over member states’ corporate taxation powers with a common corporation tax base, banning sovereign states from increasing their competitiveness by cutting corporation tax below 15%.</p>
<p>This is a move to eventually outlaw cash within the Eurozone and implement a digital currency system. The <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-ecb-banknote-idUKKCN0XV23X" target="_blank">500 euro note</a> has already been scrapped, and in Sweden, the whole system is being adapted to outlaw cash altogether with the implementation of a full <a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/sweden-cashless-society-negative-interest-rates-2015-10?r=US&amp;IR=T" target="_blank">digital currency scheme</a>.</p>
<p>No doubt, the future of the EU is one of heavy processing of all financial data, all transactions, all taxation will be implemented under one digital databank and when the cashless euro is introduced, there will be nowhere to hide within the Orwellian dystopian nightmare.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Responding to the IFS&#8217;s study, &#8216;Brexit and the UK&#8217;s public finances&#8217;, <b>Andrea Leadsom MP </b>said:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s no wonder people are being turned off this debate given the continuous campaign to do down the British economy from EU-funded organisations. So many of these studies are based on entirely negative assumptions about our economy and the future decisions a UK Government outside the EU would make, but ignore the pressing need of EU countries to continue trading with the UK. They also ignore the very real risk of what will happen if we vote &#8216;In&#8217;; more money and power to a Brussels interested only in propping up an ailing eurozone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8216;If we Vote Leave we can secure our economic security for future generations based on expanding our trade across the globe, turbocharging our economy and taking control of our borders. On 23 June the safer option is to Vote Leave.&#8217;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><b>The IFS is wrong about the level of the UK&#8217;s contributions to the EU budget.</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>The IFS uses the NIESR&#8217;s study as the basis for its forecasts. The NIESR has been wrong time and time again on the EU.</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Even the IFS has to admit that any hypothetical &#8216;hit&#8217; will be small and less than the OBR&#8217;s past errors in fiscal forecasting.</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>The IFS is wrong to claim trade will not become more expensive in the long-term.</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>The UK will not become a less attractive destination for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI).</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>The IFS is not a neutral organisation in this campaign. It would face an £800,000 deficit if we Vote Leave.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The IFS is wrong about the level of the UK&#8217;s contributions to the EU budget.</b></p>
<p><b><i>Contrary to the IFS&#8217;s claim, the UK does pay £350 million per week to the EU.</i></b> In 2014, the UK&#8217;s gross contributions to the EU budget were <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=/economy/nationalaccounts/balanceofpayments/compendium/unitedkingdombalanceofpaymentsthepinkbook/2015-10-30/unitedkingdombalanceofpaymentsthepinkbook/pinkbook2015chapter9_tcm77-422053.xls" target="_blank">£19,107 million</a>, or £367 million per week. The Head of the UK Statistics Authority, <a href="http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/public-administration-and-constitutional-affairs-committee/uk-statistics-authority/oral/32839.pdf#page=20" target="_blank">Sir Andrew Dilnot</a>, has said &#8216;Yes, the £19.1 billion figure is a legitimate figure for gross contributions&#8230; the official statistics are the £19.1 billion&#8217;.</p>
<p><i><strong>The <a href="http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/treasury-committee/the-uks-eu-budget-contributions/oral/16888.html" target="_blank">IFS </a>wrongly deducts the rebate from the gross figure.</strong> The rebate is a discretionary grant which the European Commission can pay to the UK if it so chooses. There is no obligation on the Commission to pay it. As the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, has said: &#8216;It is not a unilateral decision of the British Treasury or the British Government to just say, &#8220;This is our rebate. We are entitled to it. Pay up&#8221;. The way this works and has always worked is there is a negotiation with the European Commission&#8217;.</i></p>
<p><strong>The IFS underestimates the net contribution</strong>. In 2014, the UK&#8217;s net contribution was <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=/economy/nationalaccounts/balanceofpayments/compendium/unitedkingdombalanceofpaymentsthepinkbook/2015-10-30/unitedkingdombalanceofpaymentsthepinkbook/pinkbook2015chapter9_tcm77-422053.xls" target="_blank">£9.872 billion</a>. This rose to <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=/economy/nationalaccounts/balanceofpayments/datasets/balanceofpaymentsstatisticalbulletintables/current/balanceofpayments2015q4.xls" target="_blank">£10.649 billion</a> in 2015. This is much higher than the £8 billion suggested by the IFS, which takes into account payments to the private sector to the UK without taking into account money paid by British companies to the EU. The overall balance between the <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=/economy/nationalaccounts/balanceofpayments/compendium/unitedkingdombalanceofpaymentsthepinkbook/2015-10-30/unitedkingdombalanceofpaymentsthepinkbook/pinkbook2015chapter6_tcm77-420404.xls" target="_blank">UK </a>and the <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=/economy/nationalaccounts/balanceofpayments/compendium/unitedkingdombalanceofpaymentsthepinkbook/2015-10-30/unitedkingdombalanceofpaymentsthepinkbook/pinkbook2015chapter9_tcm77-422053.xls" target="_blank">EU </a>institutions (the current account deficit added to the capital account surplus) was £10.9 billion in 2014.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The IFS uses the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR)&#8217;s study as the basis for its forecasts. The NIESR has been wrong time and time again on the EU.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><strong>The <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/pressure-grows-for-early-vote-on-euro-after-report-says-tests-have-been-met-9211440.html" target="_blank">NIESR </a>backed scrapping the pound, which would have been a disaster</strong>. &#8216;The heavyweight and independent National Institute of Economic and Social Research agreed, saying joining Europe&#8217;s single currency would benefit Britain and that there was evidence of economic convergence with the European Union&#8217; . The NIESR said: &#8216;Part of the foreign investment in Britain appears to take place because Britain offers a gateway to the European Union. If the United Kingdom remains outside the monetary union, then other countries are likely to offer a more attractive gateway&#8217; (Birmingham Post, 29 July 2000, p. 19). A report by the NIESR in 2002 stated that: &#8216;We would argue the Chancellor&#8217;s five tests can be seen to be answered in the affirmative, and that the case for joining is clear&#8217;. In April 2003, the NIESR concluded that: &#8216;There is no longer a case for waiting&#8217;.</i></p>
<p><strong>The NIESR recommended rejoining the ERM after Black Wednesday, which would have been a disaster</strong>. &#8216;Among the most optimistic is Andrew Britton of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research who believes that Britain will have to return to the ERM, though not for another six months at least&#8217; (Evening Standard, 30 September 1992, p. 29).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Even the IFS has to admit that any hypothetical &#8216;hit&#8217; will be small and less than the OBR&#8217;s past errors in forecasting.</b></p>
<p>The report states that the effects of leaving the EU &#8216;would certainly be much smaller than the effect of the 2008 recession, which hit the public finances to the tune of around £175 billion. Indeed, it would be below the downgrades to the forecasts made by the OBR between the Budgets of March 2011 and March 2013 (estimated at £43 billion). We have coped with those.&#8217;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The IFS is wrong to claim trade will not become more expensive in the long-term.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><strong>It is in other EU countries interests to strike a free trade agreement.</strong> </i>The EU sells the UK far more than the UK sells the EU<i>.</i> In 2015, the UK bought<a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=/economy/nationalaccounts/balanceofpayments/datasets/balanceofpaymentsstatisticalbulletintables/current/balanceofpayments2015q4.xls" target="_blank"> £67.8 billion</a> more in goods and services than the UK sold to the EU. In 2014, <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=/economy/nationalaccounts/balanceofpayments/compendium/unitedkingdombalanceofpaymentsthepinkbook/2015-10-30/unitedkingdombalanceofpaymentsthepinkbook/pinkbook2015chapter9_tcm77-422053.xls" target="_blank">20 EU member states</a> sold the UK more than the UK bought from them in 2014. The <a href="http://www.niesr.ac.uk/blog/after-brexit-how-important-would-uk-trade-be-eu#.Vyd4HFUrJhH" target="_blank">UK is the EU&#8217;s largest single export market for goods</a>, larger even than the United States, with whom the EU is presently trying to negotiate a free trade agreement.</p>
<p><strong>Even pro-EU campaigners have conceded the UK will strike a free trade agreement</strong>. The Prime Minister, David Cameron, has admitted: &#8216;<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/060113.pdf" target="_blank">If we were outside the EU altogether, we&#8217;d still be trading with all these European countries, of course we would</a> &#8230; Of course the trading would go on &#8230; There&#8217;s a lot of scaremongering on all sides of this debate. Of course the trading would go on&#8217;. The <a href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com/lords/?id=2015-11-02a.1492.2" target="_blank">CBI</a>, The UK&#8217;s former Ambassador to the EU and leading supporter of the BSE campaign, Lord Kerr of Kinlochard, the pro-EU<a href="http://www.cer.org.uk/sites/default/files/publications/attachments/pdf/2014/report_smc_final_report_june2014-9013.pdf#page=33" target="_blank"> Centre for European Reform</a> all agree with him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The UK will not become a less attractive destination for foreign direct investment (FDI).</b></p>
<p>There is very little evidence that being in the EU has had much of an impact on investment flows into the UK. Historically EU countries have not been major investors. <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/fdi/foreign-direct-investment/2014/rft-1.xls" target="_blank">Official figures show</a> that the total net foreign direct investment (FDI) into the UK from the EU has been in decline over the last ten years, with the EU actually <i>disinvesting </i>in the UK in 2010 and 2013.</p>
<p>Despite the referendum and the prospect of a British exit from the EU, the Chinese investment group <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-34575039" target="_blank">SinoFortone</a> announced <strong>£5.2 billion</strong> of investment into the UK in October 2015. In November 2015, the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/more-than-9-billion-in-commercial-deals-agreed-during-prime-minister-modi-visit" target="_blank">UK and India struck <strong>£9 billion</strong> worth of commercial deals</a>, with the Government noting that: &#8216;India invests more in the UK than the rest of the European Union combined&#8217;.</p>
<p><strong>Major international investors have made clear that they will continue to invest in the UK regardless of the result of the referendum:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.toyotauk.com/ecManager/userfiles/file/Why%20we%20located%20here.pdf" target="_blank">Toyota </a>has been clear that it has located in the UK because of the tradition of UK vehicle manufacturing and the large domestic market, as well as good transport, workforce, working practices, the English language and a supportive government. The EU is not even mentioned on its list of factors. Its chief executive, <a href="https://next.ft.com/content/1afaf414-b81f-11e5-b151-8e15c9a029fb" target="_blank">Akio Toyoda</a>, has pledged to keep building cars in the UK in the event of a Leave vote.</p>
<p>Nissan announced a <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/industry/engineering/11840148/Nissan-to-invest-100m-in-Sunderland-plant-as-new-Juke-gets-the-green-light.html" target="_blank">£100m investment programme</a> in their Sunderland plant last September, after it became certain that an EU referendum would take place. Its Chief Performance Office, <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/29340906-b2d6-11e5-8358-9a82b43f6b2f.html#axzz3wvOGAaDY" target="_blank">Trevor Mann</a>, has said that, with a future UK-EU trade agreement, &#8216;[Brexit] wouldn&#8217;t make a lot of difference&#8217;. Carlos Ghosn, <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/29340906-b2d6-11e5-8358-9a82b43f6b2f.html#axzz3wvOGAaDY" target="_blank">Chief Executive of Renault-Nissan</a>, has similarly commented that &#8216;I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s a reason to worry&#8217;.</p>
<p>Hitachi&#8217;s Chief Executive, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/12132324/Hitachi-to-remain-in-UK-regardless-of-Brexit-vote.html" target="_blank">Takahiro Hachigo</a>, has also confirmed that the company will continue to do business here after a British exit from the EU. In March last year, Honda also announced a <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/31/honda-200m-investment-record-week-uk-car-industry-swindon-factory-civic" target="_blank">£200m investment programme in the UK car industry</a>.</p>
<p>Major international investors have made clear that they want the UK to have a <i>looser </i>relationship with the European Union. In an <a href="http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/Ernst-and-Youngs-attractiveness-survey-UK-2013-No-room-for-complacency/$FILE/EY_UK_Attractiveness_2013.pdf#page=7" target="_blank">EY</a> survey it was found that <strong>72% of US investors and 66% of Asian investors wanted the UK to reduce its links to the EU</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The IFS is not a neutral organisation. It would face an £800,000 deficit if we Vote Leave.</b></p>
<p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has received €7.4m from the EU since 2007. <strong>It is not an independent organisation, but a paid-up propaganda arm of the European Commission, as the table below shows.</strong></p>

<p>In addition, the IFS states that in 2014, <a href="http://www.ifs.org.uk/about/finance" target="_blank">11% of its research funding came from the EU</a>. It states that it has received £4,118,651 from the European Research Council in total and received £792,931 in 2014 alone.</p>
<p><strong>This means that if we Vote Leave, the IFS will face a financial deficit of £792,931, or 11% of its income. It is therefore in the IFS&#8217;s interests to adjust its skewed biased report figures to favour membership of the EU.</strong></p>

<p>Responding to the publication of Britain Stronger in Europe (BSE)&#8217;s first referendum campaign <a href="https://amp.twimg.com/v/f05e6ef0-d2fc-4cda-9e6a-c1ae0cb0642f" target="_blank">broadcast</a>, <b>Vote Leave Chief Executive Matthew Elliott</b> said:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8216;Pro-EU campaigners are repeating the same myths they told us when they declared it would be a disaster if we didn&#8217;t join the euro. They were wrong then and they are wrong now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s amazing to see the BSE campaign claiming to have a positive message having spent the last 8 months doing down the British economy and our position in the world. <strong>On 23 June the safe option is to Vote Leave and take back control of the £350 million we hand Brussels every week</strong>.&#8217;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;"><strong>BSE False Claims Debunked</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Over 3 million UK jobs are linked to our trade with the EU.&#8217;</b></p>
<p>The figure was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010423154951/http://www.britainineurope.org/resources/northwestjobfigures.htm" target="_blank">invented</a> by pro-euro campaigners. In 2000, Britain in Europe, the campaign to scrap the pound, claimed that 3 million jobs were &#8216;facing the axe&#8217; if the UK left the EU.</p>
<p>The academic whose work they traduced, Dr Martin Weale, dismissed the claim as &#8216;<a href="http://www.sunnation.co.uk/labours-pro-eu-campaign-descends-into-farce-with-false-jobs-claim/" target="_blank">pure Goebbels</a>. In many years of academic research, I cannot recall such a wilful distortion of the facts&#8217;.</p>
<p>Even the Treasury (whose forecasts are extremely pessimistic) <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/524967/hm_treasury_analysis_the_immediate_economic_impact_of_leaving_the_eu_web.pdf#page=54" target="_blank">refuses to endorse the claim</a>, saying the true figure is a sixth of this total. The Executive Director of the Prime Minister&#8217;s campaign, Will Straw, has admitted: &#8216;<a href="http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/treasury-committee/the-economic-and-financial-costs-and-benefits-of-uks-eu-membership/oral/30171.pdf" target="_blank">We have not and have never claimed that 3 million jobs would be lost if we left the EU</a>&#8216;.</p>
<p>It has been estimated that, if we Vote Leave, and strike free trade deals with all the countries that the EU has failed to secure FTAs with, it could create <a href="http://www.voteleavetakecontrol.org/vote_leave_to_create_300_000_british_jobs" target="_blank">300,000 British jobs</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Over 200,000 UK businesses trade with the EU.&#8217;</b></p>
<p>This amounts to just <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/467443/bpe_2015_statistical_release.pdf#page=3" target="_blank">3.7%</a> of the UK&#8217;s <strong>5.39 million</strong> businesses.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that only a small proportion of UK businesses trade with the EU, every business has to comply with EU law, which <a href="http://openeurope.org.uk/intelligence/britain-and-the-eu/top-100-eu-rules-cost-britain-33-3bn/" target="_blank">costs UK businesses <strong>£600 million per week</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>This BSE figure is <strong>deceptive</strong> since it includes not just businesses which export, but also those which import. Since no rational Government would make it more difficult for British businesses to import goods after we Vote Leave, the figure is a <strong>significant overestimate</strong>.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister, David Cameron, has accepted trade would continue, meaning <strong>jobs would not be put at risk</strong>: &#8216;<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/060113.pdf#page=12" target="_blank">If we were outside the EU altogether, we&#8217;d still be trading with all these European countries, of course we would</a> &#8230; There&#8217;s a lot of scaremongering on all sides of this debate. Of course the trading would go on&#8217;.</p>
<p>When asked whether he agreed with the Prime Minister, the Executive Director of the IN campaign, Will Straw, said he did so &#8216;<a href="http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/treasury-committee/the-economic-and-financial-costs-and-benefits-of-uks-eu-membership/oral/30171.pdf#page=43" target="_blank">absolutely</a>&#8216;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Companies from around the world set up factories and offices here so they can do business throughout Europe, meaning more opportunities&#8217;.</b></p>
<p>Not even the Head of the IN campaign, <a href="https://corporate.sky.com/media-centre/media-packs/2015/murnaghan-interview-with-lord-levy,-labour-peer-and-lord-rose,-conservative-peer-190415" target="_blank">Lord Rose</a>, has said he doesn&#8217;t believe this claim &#8216;for a moment&#8217; and that it is &#8216;all a red herring and it is just scaremongering&#8217;. He said just last year that: &#8216;The reason that people want to come to this country is because we have a flexible workforce, because we have stability, because we&#8217;ve got a growing economy, because we&#8217;ve got strong IPR, because this is a place to do business.  I think it&#8217;s ridiculous to suggest that everybody is going to suddenly go offshore, I don&#8217;t believe that for one moment &#8230; so I think this is all a red herring and it is just scaremongering.</p>

<p><b>&#8216;The UK gets £66 million of investment a day from EU countries.&#8217;</b></p>
<p>These figures are <strong>wrong</strong>. In 2014, net Foreign Direct Investment <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/fdi/foreign-direct-investment/2014/rft-1.xls" target="_blank">(FDI) flows into the UK from the EU</a> were £5,268 million or £14.4 million per day.</p>
<p>BSE wrongly suggests companies only invest because of EU membership, implying it would fall if we left the EU. Similar claims of a fall in FDI were made if the UK did not join the euro or even held a referendum on the EU. In fact, &#8216;FDI liabilities grew from £481.1 billion to £588.9 billion from the EU&#8217; between <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171776_430951.pdf" target="_blank">2011 and 2014</a>, during a period in which overall FDI into the UK rose. This shows that FDI continued to grow in the two years following David Cameron&#8217;s January 2013 Bloomberg Speech, suggesting the prospect of leaving the EU has had no effect on investment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>&#8216;And when you&#8217;re at work, your rights are secured by EU legislation: paid holiday and sick leave, equal rights, maternity and paternity leave, all protected by EU law.&#8217;</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><strong>The UK had legislation on paid holidays before it joined</strong>. Its current legislation is more generous than EU law. </i>The UK had legislation on paid holidays before we joined the EU. The <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6/1-2/70/enacted" target="_blank">Holidays with Pay Act</a> was passed in July 1938, creating a right to paid holidays. The UK has also been more generous than EU law, with <a href="https://www.gov.uk/holiday-entitlement-rights/entitlement" target="_blank">5.6 weeks entitlement each year</a>, rather than the four contained in <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32003L0088" target="_blank">EU law</a>.</p>
<p><strong><i>Maternity pay is more generous under UK law. </i></strong><a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2006/2379/regulation/3/made" target="_blank">Statutory maternity pay</a> lasts for 39 weeks under UK law Statutory Maternity Pay. This is much more generous than <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1458037207224&amp;uri=CELEX:01992L0085-20140325" target="_blank">EU law</a>, which provides for a period of 14 weeks. <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/22/section/19" target="_blank">UK legislation</a> also gives women the right to receive 90% of their salary during the first six weeks of leave. <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1458037207224&amp;uri=CELEX:01992L0085-20140325" target="_blank">EU law</a> only requires that the rate of pay be equivalent to statutory sick pay in this period. This is <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2015/30/article/3/made" target="_blank">£88.45 per week</a>.</p>
<p><strong><i>UK law on parental leave is more generous than EU law. </i></strong>The same is true of parental leave. UK maternity leave may be taken for up to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/employers-maternity-pay-leave/entitlement" target="_blank">52 weeks</a>. EU law only requires a period of <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1458041876933&amp;uri=CELEX:02010L0018-20140101" target="_blank">four months</a>. <strong>There is no need to accept the supremacy of EU law to protect workers&#8217; rights.</strong></p>
<p><b><i>The UK had legislation against discrimination long before the EU did. </i></b>The UK passed the legislation against race discrimination, the Race Relations Act 1965 and the Race Relations Act 1968, before we joined the EU. As High Court Judge Sir Rabinder Singh has said: &#8216;<strong>The Race Relations Act 1976</strong> [which consolidated the 1960s legislation] was perhaps one of the strongest pieces of legislation of its kind in the world and certainly in Europe. It long <a href="https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/runnymede-trust.pdf#page=6" target="_blank">predated legislation against racial discrimination in EU law</a>&#8216;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Being in Europe also means families enjoy lower prices in our shops and supermarkets. This saves an average household £350 a year &#8211; so as Sam grows older, he&#8217;ll have more money to put aside&#8217;.</b></p>
<p>The independent House of Commons Library has concluded that <strong><a href="http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN06730/SN06730.pdf" target="_blank">EU membership actually <i>increases</i> the costs of consumer goods</a></strong>, stating that the EU&#8217;s Common Agricultural Policy &#8216;artificially inflates food prices&#8217; and that &#8216;consumer prices across a range of other goods imported from outside the EU are raised as a result of the common external tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade imposed by the EU. These include footwear (a 17% tariff), bicycles (15% tariff) and a range of clothing (12% tariff)&#8217;.</p>
<p><strong>The EU also requires us to charge household energy bills to value added tax of 5%</strong>, <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:02006L0112-20150101" target="_blank">increasing the cost of living for low income families</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A62009CJ0236" target="_blank"><strong>The European Court has increased the cost of insurance.</strong></a> In March 2011, the European Court ruled that the EU&#8217;s Charter of Fundamental Rights meant that women could not be charged lower premiums than men, increasing the cost of car and life insurance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Remaining in Europe will keep our economy stronger &#8211; so we can invest more in vital services like schools and the NHS&#8217; </b></p>
<p>Being in the EU means that we have to pay an annual gross contribution of <strong>£19.107bn to the EU</strong>. That&#8217;s over <strong>£350m every week</strong>. That means that there are <strong>less funds available for our NHS and schools.</strong></p>
<p>In 2014, the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-29726934" target="_blank">NHS Chief Executive, Simon Stevens</a>, said the NHS would need an additional £8 billion real terms increase in spending by 2020 to keep even. This is <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/483344/EU_finances_2015_final_web_09122015.pdf#page=21" target="_blank">less</a> than the net contributions that the UK is forecast to make to the EU over the same period.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>&#8216;It&#8217;s a leap in the dark&#8217;.</b></p>
<p>Not even the Head of the IN campaign, Lord Rose, can bring himself to agree with this. He has said &#8216;<a href="http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/politics/article4588253.ece" target="_blank">it&#8217;s not going to be a step change or somebody&#8217;s going to turn the lights out</a>&#8216;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>&#8216;[it] would leave UK families £4,300 worse off&#8217;.</b></p>
<p>The Government calculated the £4,300 figure by dividing a putative lesser increase in GDP of 6.2% by the current number of households. <strong>This is extremely disingenuous</strong>, as official statistics show that the number of households in 2030 is projected to grow to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/live-tables-on-household-projections#history" target="_blank">31.213 million</a>. This is up from 26.994 in 2015, an <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/families/datasets/familiesandhouseholdsfamiliesandhouseholds/current/familieshouseholdsv2_tcm77-422171.xls" target="_blank">increase of <strong>4.219 million</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The report does not quantify any potential savings of not having to apply EU regulation in the UK, but instead claims regulation would <i>increase</i> if we Vote Leave.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/517154/treasury_analysis_economic_impact_of_eu_membership_print.pdf#page=139" target="_blank">report</a> asserts that: &#8216;under any of the alternatives, the potential gains from additional flexibility on leaving the EU are likely to be significantly constrained, including because of domestic priorities and international obligations. These would be future government decisions. In any case, any potential gains from reduced EU regulatory burdens in specific areas would be significantly outweighed by the losses from the increased regulatory barriers and divergence from no longer being a member of the Single Market. Consistent with this assessment and the approach throughout this analysis, the modelling does not prejudge these decisions and no further assumptions on regulation are made over and above the increase in regulatory barriers that would emerge over time, as captured in the modelling of the effects of the alternative arrangements on trade and FDI&#8217;.</p>
<p>In 2005, HM Treasury admitted that: &#8216;although Europe&#8217;s founders aimed to remove barriers and reap the benefits of expanded markets internally, they also sought protection and special treatment for particular aspects of their economies such as agriculture. <strong>This has brought costs</strong>: expensive subsidies still remain in some sectors and it is estimated that barriers to external trade and investment &#8211; such as tariffs, quotas and unjustifiably restrictive standards &#8211; could cost Europe&#8217;s consumers up to <a href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100407010852/http:/www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/d/global_europe_131005.pdf#page=5" target="_blank">7 per cent of EU GDP</a>&#8216;.</p>
<p>This is the equivalent of <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossdomesticproductgdp/bulletins/secondestimateofgdp/quarter4octtodec2015" target="_blank">£125.2 billion per year</a> in today&#8217;s prices, or <strong>£4,638 per household</strong>.</p>
<p>This is likely an underestimate, as the <strong>burden of EU regulation has increased</strong>. <a href="http://openeurope.org.uk/intelligence/britain-and-the-eu/100-most-expensive-eu-regulations/" target="_blank">Open Europe</a>&#8216;s regular analysis of the cost of just the 100 most burdensome EU laws found in 2013 that the cost to the UK economy was £27.5 billion, but just a few months later had to uprate this to <a href="http://openeurope.org.uk/intelligence/britain-and-the-eu/top-100-eu-rules-cost-britain-33-3bn/" target="_blank">£33.3 billion</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The UK has led the way in promoting and protecting workers rights, and it&#8217;s deeply misleading to suggest that leaving the EU would put them at risk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The best way to ensure that workers rights are to protected is to have a parliament that is directly accountable to the people; in other words, to put power back in people&#8217;s hands. <strong>The EU prevents that</strong>, and means that <strong>unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats can</strong> <strong>impose rules and regulations that the British people have no say over</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;On <strong>23 June</strong> we have the opportunity to take back control of our country and our democracy, as well as the £350 million we send to Brussels every week, by voting to leave the EU.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Protection of Women&#8217;s Rights is not contingent on EU membership</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Before we joined the EU:</strong></p>
<p>In 1961 the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15984258" target="_blank">contraceptive pill</a> was made free and &#8216;available to all&#8217; on the NHS, giving women more control.</p>
<p>Parliament passed the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1967/87/contents" target="_blank">Abortion Act 1967</a>, providing women greater autonomy.</p>
<p>Parliament passed the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1969/55/contents/enacted" target="_blank">Divorce Reform Act 1969</a>, allowing spouses an easier escape from unhappy.</p>
<p>Parliament passed the first <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1970/41" target="_blank">Equal Pay Act 1970</a>, demanding &#8216;equal pay for equal work&#8217;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>We have also since passed, without assistance from the EU:</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1975/65" target="_blank">Sex Discrimination Act 1975</a>, guarding against sexual harassment in the workplace.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1975/71/contents" target="_blank">Employment Protection Act 1975</a>, supporting mothers with paid maternity leave.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/28/contents" target="_blank">Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004</a>, seeking justice for and providing assistance to the victims of domestic violence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Membership of the EU actually undermines Women&#8217;s Rights and their interests</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><i>Car insurance:</i></strong> Decisions by European Courts have <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=62009CJ0236&amp;lang1=en&amp;type=TXT&amp;ancre=" target="_blank">increased the cost of life and car insurance for women</a>. The ECJ has held that its Charter of Fundamental Rights prevented insurance companies from charging women lower premiums.</p>
<p><i><strong>Impact on family finances</strong>: </i>The independent House of Commons Library has concluded that <a href="http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN06730/SN06730.pdf" target="_blank">EU membership increases the costs of consumer goods</a>, stating that the EU&#8217;s Common Agricultural Policy &#8216;artificially inflates food prices&#8217; and that &#8216;consumer prices across a range of other goods imported from outside the EU are raised as a result of the common external tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade imposed by the EU. These include footwear (a 17% tariff), bicycles (15% tariff) and a range of clothing (12% tariff)&#8217;.</p>
<p><strong> The <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2006:347:0001:0118:en:PDF" target="_blank">VAT Directive</a> </strong>also requires the charging to VAT of domestic supplies of fuel and power. The 1997 Labour Party Manifesto stated that &#8216;<strong>the tragedy is that those hardest hit are least able to pay. That is why we strongly opposed the imposition of VAT on fuel.</strong>&#8216; However, the party could only pledge to &#8216;cut VAT on fuel to five per cent, the <a href="http://www.politicsresources.net/area/uk/man/lab97.htm" target="_blank">lowest level allowed</a>&#8216;. When the Labour Party proposed a reduced rate of 17.5% VAT on petrol in 2011, the Economic Secretary to the Treasury, Justine Greening, said that <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110316/debtext/110316-0002.htm" target="_blank">EU law does &#8216;not permit a reduced rate or exemption to be applied to transport fuel&#8217;</a>, and that renegotiating EU VAT rules could take as much as six years.</p>
<p><strong><i>Taxation of sanitary products: </i></strong>The VAT Directive also requires the UK to charge <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2006:347:0001:0118:en:PDF" target="_blank">sanitary products and contraception to tax of at least 5%</a>. This means a requirement to charge <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-politics/11957182/Tampon-tax-Government-promises-to-ask-EU-to-ditch-VAT.html" target="_blank">VAT on tampons</a>, despite the opposition of Government Ministers and a majority of MPs. As the Treasury Minister, David Gauke has admitted: &#8216;any change to EU VAT law would require a proposal from the European Commission and the support of all 28 member states. Without that agreement, <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmhansrd/cm151026/debtext/151026-0004.htm" target="_blank">we are not permitted to lower rates below 5%</a>&#8216;.</p>
<p><strong><i>Abortion: </i></strong>Abortion was legalised in Great Britain in 1967. Nonetheless, the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:060:0131:0139:EN:PDF#page=2" target="_blank">EU Treaties specifically grant the Republic of Ireland the right to ban abortion</a>.</p>

<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Mr Grayling began his speech by stating that a politician in the United States would struggle to garner support by advocating joining an organisation which mirrored the European Union:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8216;There should also be Supreme Court of the Americas, perhaps in Venezuela, to outrank the US&#8217;s own Supreme Court, and to take decisions that will be mandatory in the United States.</p>
<p>&#8216;We should even consider having an army of the Americas, and do away with antiquated ideas like the United States having its own military.</p>
<p>&#8216;And to achieve this dream, we have to give every citizen of the Americas the right to live and work wherever he or she chooses across the whole of North and South America&#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8216;&#8230;Suggesting that the United States should be part of such an organisation does not seem to me to be a political platform likely to command widespread support here.&#8217;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>He went on to highlight how the creation of the euro has been damaging for the EU, and that a solution to the problem is difficult to find:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8216;The seminal moment for the European Union came seventeen years ago with the creation of the single currency. In my view the countries that joined the euro created the economic equivalent of the San Andreas fault. They tried to create a single economy in a geographic area where there was no single government, no common culture or commonality of performance, and where the traditional escape valves when things went wrong in underperforming nations simply disappeared&#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8216;&#8230;But there&#8217;s no easy solution either. You can&#8217;t just kick a country out of the Eurozone without creating that massive collapse either. If Greece had been forced out of the Euro, it would have been left with a devalued currency, unable to afford to pay its Euro-denominated debts. It would have defaulted and left massive losses across the continent. And then the pressure would have built up on other countries, and the contagion would have spread. And would spread if and when all of this happens again.&#8217;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>The Leader of the House of Commons discussed how as a result of the failures of the single currency, the eurozone must integrate further:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8216;The plans are already taking shape. Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor, her deputy Wolfgang Schauble, the Italian Finance Minister, the French President Francois Hollande, the Speakers of the biggest Eurozone Parliaments, the Presidents of the big EU institutions have all called for political union. It means, according to Hollande, a Eurozone Parliament, a common budget and a common cabinet. Inevitably it means giving up independent nation status.&#8217;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Although recognising that the UK is outside the euro, Mr Grayling explained how this integration will still have a major impact on Britain:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8216;And as the member countries of the Eurozone move to unify more and more of the way they govern themselves, many of those changes inevitably will be applied to the UK as well – because we are already subject to EU-wide legislation in those areas. So if the Eurozone takes a decision about how to operate its banks, Britain and the City of London are affected by the same rule changes and we can do nothing about it.</p>
<p>&#8216;As the Eurozone federates, and the EU becomes a single block with a single Government, what happens to the bit stuck on the edge? The UK. We will have little ability to defend our national interest. We will be outvoted all the time. But more and more of our law-making will be sucked into Brussels. We will be of marginal importance while footing a large slice of the bill.&#8217;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>He concluded by suggesting that President Obama was wrong to intervene in the EU referendum debate. However he assured attendees that no matter the result of the vote, the UK would continue to have a special relationship with the US:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8216;Inside or outside the EU, Britain&#8217;s relationship with the United States will and must remain strong. Neither of us should ever be at the back of the line when it comes to working together. If Britain chooses to leave, our partnerships in defence, in intelligence, in counter-terrorism, in trade and in culture should remain strong and unchanged. Neither of us would benefit from growing apart, and neither of us should want that to happen, regardless of how Britain chooses to shape its future.&#8217;</p>

<p>Responding to David Cameron unveiling a new Britain Stronger in Europe (BSE) campaign poster, Vote Leave is today publishing a series of graphics that highlight the costs of voting to remain in the EU. These include:</p>
<p><b>The cost of staying in the EU: <a href="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/voteleave/pages/271/attachments/original/1463154553/4_300_Poster_Digi_VL1.jpg?1463154553" target="_blank">£4,600 for every household</a> </b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Commenting, <b>Vote Leave Chief Executive Matthew Elliott</b> said:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8216;David Cameron knows that not a single British family would lose that amount of money if we Vote Leave. In fact they would prosper as we spend our money on our priorities. Sadly, he failed to win even the most modest reforms to the EU in the renegotiation. He failed to keep his promise and make a positive case for the EU, choosing instead to do down Britain. Now he&#8217;s failing to be honest with hardworking families about the costs of the EU.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8216;We hand £50 million to Brussels every day while EU regulations undermine our economy, democracy and borders. On 23 June it is safer to take control and Vote Leave.&#8217;</p>

This has brought costs: expensive subsidies still remain in some sectors and it is estimated that barriers to external trade and investment – such as tariffs, quotas and unjustifiably restrictive standards – could cost Europe&#8217;s consumers up to 7 per cent of EU GDP&#8217;.</p>
<p>This is the equivalent of £125.2 billion per year in today&#8217;s prices, or <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossdomesticproductgdp/bulletins/secondestimateofgdp/quarter4octtodec2015" target="_blank">£4,638</a> per household.</p>

<p><b>The cost of EU membership: £50 million every single day (Source: Office for National Statistics)</b></p>
<p>In 2014, the UK paid <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=/economy/nationalaccounts/balanceofpayments/compendium/unitedkingdombalanceofpaymentsthepinkbook/2015-10-30/unitedkingdombalanceofpaymentsthepinkbook/pinkbook2015chapter9_tcm77-422053.xls">£19.107 billion</a> (gross) to the EU institutions.</p>
<p>This is the equivalent of £367.4 million per week, or £52.3 million per day.</p>
<p>The Head of the Statistics Authority, Sir Andrew Dilnot CBE, has said &#8216;Yes, the <a href="http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/public-administration-and-constitutional-affairs-committee/uk-statistics-authority/oral/32839.pdf#page=20" target="_blank">£19.1 billion</a> figure is a legitimate figure for gross contributions &#8230; the official statistics are the £19.1 billion&#8217;.</p>

<p><b>The cost of EU membership: 250,000 EU immigrants every single year (Source: Office for National Statistics)</b></p>
<p>In the year ending September 2015, the inflow of EU migrants was <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/internationalmigration/datasets/migrationstatisticsquarterlyreportprovisionallongterminternationalmigrationltimestimates" target="_blank">257,000</a>.</p>
<p>This is equivalent to a city the size of Newcastle, Plymouth, or Wolverhampton.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Government and BSE&#8217;s £4,300 figure is bogus</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Government calculates the £4,300 figure by dividing a putative 6% lesser increase in GDP growth by 2030 by the </b><b><i>current </i></b><b>number of households. </b></p>
<p>The Government divides the putative lesser increase in GDP of 6.2% by the current number of households.</p>
<p>This is extremely disingenuous, as official statistics show that the number of households in 2030 is projected to grow to<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/live-tables-on-household-projections#history" target="_blank"> 31.213 million</a>. This is up from 26.994 in 2015, an increase of <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/families/datasets/familiesandhouseholdsfamiliesandhouseholds/current/familieshouseholdsv2_tcm77-422171.xls" target="_blank">4.219 million</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The report fails to consider the costs of EU regulation, which the Treasury has previously admitted are as high as 7% of GDP, or £4,638 per household.</b></p>
<p>The report does not quantify any potential savings of not having to apply EU regulation in the UK, but instead claims regulation would <i>increase</i> if we <strong>Vote Leave</strong>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/517154/treasury_analysis_economic_impact_of_eu_membership_print.pdf#page=139" target="_blank">report</a> asserts that: &#8216;under any of the alternatives, the potential gains from additional flexibility on leaving the EU are likely to be significantly constrained, including because of domestic priorities and international obligations. These would be future government decisions. In any case, any potential gains from reduced EU regulatory burdens in specific areas would be significantly outweighed by the losses from the increased regulatory barriers and divergence from no longer being a member of the Single Market. Consistent with this assessment and the approach throughout this analysis, the modelling does not prejudge these decisions and no further assumptions on regulation are made over and above the increase in regulatory barriers that would emerge over time, as captured in the modelling of the effects of the alternative arrangements on trade and FDI&#8217;.</p>
<p>In 2005, <a href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100407010852/http:/www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/d/global_europe_131005.pdf#page=5" target="_blank">HM Treasury</a> admitted that: &#8216;although Europe&#8217;s founders aimed to remove barriers and reap the benefits of expanded markets internally, they also sought protection and special treatment for particular aspects of their economies such as agriculture. This has brought costs: expensive subsidies still remain in some sectors and it is estimated that barriers to external trade and investment &#8211; such as tariffs, quotas and unjustifiably restrictive standards &#8211; could cost Europe&#8217;s consumers up to 7 per cent of EU GDP&#8217;.</p>
<p>This is the equivalent of <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossdomesticproductgdp/bulletins/secondestimateofgdp/quarter4octtodec2015" target="_blank">£125.2 billion per year</a> in today&#8217;s prices, or <strong>£4,638 per household</strong>.</p>
<p>This is likely an underestimate, as the burden of EU regulation has increased. <a href="http://openeurope.org.uk/intelligence/britain-and-the-eu/100-most-expensive-eu-regulations/" target="_blank">Open Europe</a>&#8216;s regular analysis of the cost of just the 100 most burdensome EU laws found in 2013 that the cost to the UK economy was £27.5 billion, but just a few months later had to uprate this to £33.3 billion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The £4,300 figure is based on the Government breaking its promise to reduce net migration to the tens of thousands in every year of this Parliament.</b></p>
<p>The Government&#8217;s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/517154/treasury_analysis_economic_impact_of_eu_membership_print.pdf#page=138" target="_blank">document</a> states that: &#8216;The population and migration projections which underlie the modelling were used by the OBR in their Economic and fiscal outlook accompanying Budget 2016. It is assumed that population growth will slow in line with the ONS&#8217;s current principal population projections. In the principal projection, total net international migration to the UK falls from 329,000 per year in 2014 towards 185,000 per year from 2021 onwards&#8217;.</p>
<p>The OBR&#8217;s central forecast is that net migration will be in excess of the 100,000 target in every year of this Parliament, contrary to the Government&#8217;s manifesto.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.conservatives.com/%7E/media/files/activist%20centre/press%20and%20policy/manifestos/manifesto2010" target="_blank">2010 Conservative Manifesto</a> promised that &#8216;we will take steps to take net migration back to the levels of the 1990s – tens of thousands a year, not hundreds of thousands&#8217;.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/manifesto2015/ConservativeManifesto2015.pdf#page=31" target="_blank">2015 Conservative Manifesto</a> pledged to &#8216;keep our ambition of delivering annual net migration in the tens of thousands, not the hundreds of thousands&#8217;.</p>
<p>The lowest net migration has been since 2010 was <a href="http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/HTMLDocs/dvc123/data14.xls" target="_blank">177,000</a> in 2012. Net migration in 2014 was 313,000, of which 174,000 persons came from the EU.</p>
<p>In her speech to the 2015 Conservative Party conference in Manchester, the Home Secretary, <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/theresa-may-s-speech-to-the-conservative-party-conference-in-full-a6681901.html" target="_blank">Theresa May</a>, said: &#8216;not all of the consequences can be managed, and doing so for many of them comes at a high price&#8230; But even if we could manage all the consequences of mass immigration, Britain does not need net migration in the hundreds of thousands every year&#8230; The evidence – from the OECD, the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee and many academics – shows that while there are benefits of selective and controlled immigration, at best the net economic and fiscal effect of high immigration is close to zero.  So there is no case, in the national interest, for immigration of the scale we have experienced over the last decade. Neither is it true that, in the modern world, immigration is no longer possible to control&#8230; The numbers coming from Europe are unsustainable and the rules have to change&#8217;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>If there were 6% fewer households in 2030 due to lower immigration, there would be no reduction in household income at all (even assuming the Treasury are right that the economy would be 6.2% smaller in 2030 than it otherwise might have been).</b></p>
<p>The number of households in 2030 is projected to grow to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/live-tables-on-household-projections#history" target="_blank">31.213 million</a>. A 6% reduction in this forecast means 29.340 million households in the UK in 2030, an increase of 2.346 million households compared to today.</p>
<p>This means that even if household numbers grow by more than 2.3 million in the next fifteen years, the Treasury is forecasting no reduction in household incomes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The report does not consider the benefits of striking free trade deals.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The report <strong>assumes the UK would strike no new free trade deals if we Vote Leave</strong>, despite this being one of the principal economic benefits of leaving the EU.</p>
<p>In 2015, the aggregate GDP of all the countries with which the EU had a trade agreement in force was <strong><a href="http://www.civitas.org.uk/content/files/mythandparadox.pdf" target="_blank">$7.7 trillion</a></strong>.</p>
<p>By contrast, the <a href="http://www.civitas.org.uk/content/files/mythandparadox.pdf" target="_blank">aggregate GDP of all countries</a> with which Chile had trade agreements was <strong>$58.3 trillion</strong>. The figure for South Korea was <strong>$40.8 trillion</strong> and that for Switzerland was <strong>$39.8 trillion</strong>.</p>
<p>The EU has <strong>failed</strong> to negotiate a free trade agreement with China. By contrast, both <a href="https://www.mfa.is/news-and-publications/nr/7655" target="_blank">Iceland</a> (which has a population of less than half a million) and <a href="http://www.seco.admin.ch/themen/00513/02655/02731/04118/index.html?lang=en" target="_blank">Switzerland</a> have negotiated free trade agreements with China.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The report downplays the savings from the UK&#8217;s budget contributions.</b></p>
<p>The report claims that the UK&#8217;s net contribution to the EU in 2014 was <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/517154/treasury_analysis_economic_impact_of_eu_membership_print.pdf#page=195" target="_blank">£5.71 billion</a>.</p>
<p>The report admits that the contribution is a &#8216;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/517154/treasury_analysis_economic_impact_of_eu_membership_print.pdf#page=69" target="_blank">significant economic obligation</a>&#8216;.</p>
<p>In 2014, (the last year for which data are available), the UK recorded a <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=/economy/nationalaccounts/balanceofpayments/compendium/unitedkingdombalanceofpaymentsthepinkbook/2015-10-30/unitedkingdombalanceofpaymentsthepinkbook/pinkbook2015chapter9_tcm77-422053.xls" target="_blank">£12.3 billion</a> balance of payments deficit with the EU institutions.</p>
<p>This is the net sum of money paid by the UK to the EU institutions in 2014. This money would be retained in the UK if we Vote Leave, cutting the current account deficit.</p>
<p>In addition, the UK would regain full control of the <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=/economy/nationalaccounts/balanceofpayments/compendium/unitedkingdombalanceofpaymentsthepinkbook/2015-10-30/unitedkingdombalanceofpaymentsthepinkbook/pinkbook2015chapter9_tcm77-422053.xls" target="_blank">£19.1 billion</a> we currently send to Brussels.</p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">Responding to the comments from Christine Lagarde of the IMF, former Chancellor of the Exchequer <b>Lord Lamont of Lerwick </b>said:</span></p>
<div><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;This daily avalanche of institutional propaganda is becoming ludicrous and pitiful. Important institutions are being politicised and used to make blood-curdling forecasts. There are plenty of respected individual economists, plenty of respected professional investors, and plenty of entrepreneurs who take a very different view from Christine Lagarde and who have probably been better at foreseeing the future than the IMF.</span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;Not so long ago the Chancellor was berating the IMF for being too pessimistic about the British economy. Now the Government is cheering it on. Madame Lagarde says that what happens in Britain will affect other countries in Europe, including her own country France. Perhaps what she is really afraid of is that if Britain leaves the EU other countries in the EU will also want to hold referendums on their membership.&#8221;</span></div>

</ul>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Responding to the IMF&#8217;s assessment of the UK economy, <b>Priti Patel MP </b>said:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8216;The IMF warned Britain it was playing with fire when it set out a plan to deal with the deficit. Now our economy is stronger than nearly every other major economy. Today, the IMF is talking down Britain because we want to take back control from Brussels. They were wrong then and they are wrong now.</p>
<p>&#8216;The EU-funded IMF should not interfere in our democratic debate a week before polling day. It appears the Chancellor is cashing in favours to Ms Lagarde in order to encourage the IMF to bully the British people – it is a sign of the desperation in the IN campaign.&#8217;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The IMF has announced that it plans to intervene in the purdah period. </b><b>The IMF is not &#8216;independent&#8217;, but is funded by the EU. Lagarde is an employee of Osborne.</b></p>
<p>In her remarks to journalists this morning, Christine Lagarde confirmed that the IMF would release a report warning against a leave vote one week before the referendum.</p>
<p>This will be during the 28 day <strong>&#8216;<a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/41/section/125" target="_blank">purdah</a>&#8216; period</strong> <strong>which prohibits public authorities from publishing information pertaining to the referendum</strong>. The purpose of the rules is to stop taxpayers&#8217; money being spent on campaigning.</p>
<p>The IMF is taxpayer funded but has nevertheless made clear its intent to interfere in the debate. According to the Commission&#8217;s own transparency system, the IMF has received <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/budget/fts/index_en.htm" target="_blank">€168,138</a> from the European Commission since 2007.</p>
<p>George Osborne is one of the <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/memdir/members.aspx" target="_blank">voting members of the IMF Board of Governors</a> and has 203,004 votes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Christine Lagarde is a long-standing pro-EU campaigner, who believes the law should not be followed when it is inconvenient.</b></p>
<p>Ms Lagarde has said &#8216;we would like to see the euro zone be much <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-christine-lagarde-interview/" target="_blank">more integrated</a>&#8216;.</p>
<p>She has argued that <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/us-france-lagarde-idUSTRE6BH0V020101218" target="_blank">the law should be violated to further political ends</a>, stating: &#8216;We violated all the rules because we wanted to close ranks and really rescue the euro zone. The Treaty of Lisbon was very straight-forward. No bailout&#8217;.</p>
<p>She is a noted supporter of greater European integration with her proposals dubbed as steps &#8216;<a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704034804576025681087342502" target="_blank">towards a United States of Europe</a>&#8216;.</p>
<p>She has said that <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/europe-refugee-crisis-imf-chief-lagarde-says-refugees-could-boost-economy-2272459" target="_blank">uncontrolled immigration</a> in the Schengen area has &#8216;upside potential&#8217;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Christine Lagarde is facing serious criminal allegations.</b></p>
<p>Christine Lagarde has been <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financial-crime/12056620/IMF-head-Christine-Lagarde-ordered-to-face-trial-over-Bernard-Tapie-scandal.html" target="_blank">charged with negligence by a French court</a> over her alleged role in the payment of £293 million to a French businessman, Bernard Tapie. The French Republic has since ordered Mr Tapie to repay the money.</p>
<p>If convicted, Ms Lagarde could face up to a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-35121022" target="_blank">year&#8217;s imprisonment</a>. The case continues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The IMF recommends tax hikes if we vote &#8216;IN&#8217;.</b></p>
<p>The IMF recommends &#8216;measures such as scaling back distortionary tax expenditures (e.g., nonstandard VAT rates), which would also increase economic efficiency and tax neutrality.&#8217;</p>
<p>This could mean the imposition of VAT on food, books and childrens&#8217; clothing, a massive tax hike for working families. In January this year, the Economics Commissioner, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jan/28/eu-plan-cut-uk-vat-exemptions-pierre-moscovici" target="_blank">Pierre Moscovici</a>, called for further harmonisation of taxation, including scrapping the UK&#8217;s zero rates, stating a &#8216;zero rate is not the best idea&#8217;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The IMF has been consistently wrong about its forecasts for the UK economy. It is wrong now. </b></p>
<p><b><i>The IMF has tried to talk Britain&#8217;s economy down before – but its negative forecasts for the UK economy have been consistently wrong.</i></b> In 2013 the <a href="http://news.sky.com/story/1078887/imf-inflicts-double-blow-on-george-osborne" target="_blank">IMF&#8217;s chief economist, Olivier Blanchard</a>, warned that Britain&#8217;s growth prospects were very low. When challenged, the Chief Economist responded: &#8216;I am right and they are wrong&#8217;. His estimates turned out to be <strong>inaccurate</strong> and UK growth was much stronger than he predicted.</p>
<p><b><i>The IMF later had to accept that it was wrong about its warnings for the UK. </i></b>Christine Lagarde later admitted that she had &#8216;<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/10881540/IMF-accepts-it-was-wrong-on-George-Osbornes-austerity.html" target="_blank">underestimated</a>&#8216; the strength of growth when the IMF assessed the UK economy in 2013.</p>
<p><b><i>The IMF has made other <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jun/05/imf-underestimated-damage-austerity-would-do-to-greece" target="_blank">major errors of forecasting</a>. In June 2013, the IMF was forced to admit it had issued &#8216;economic projections that were too optimistic&#8217; about its joint austerity programme with the EU in Greece.</i></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Even the Head of the IN campaign has dismissed siren voices like the IMF&#8217;s. </i></b>The Chairman of the IN campaign, Lord Rose of Monewden, has admitted that there are <a href="http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/politics/article4588253.ece" target="_blank">no short-term risks in voting to leave</a>, stating: &#8216;Nothing is going to happen if we come out of Europe in the first five years &#8230; There will be absolutely no change &#8230; It&#8217;s not going to be a step change or somebody&#8217;s going to turn the lights out and we&#8217;re all suddenly going to find that we can&#8217;t go to France, it&#8217;s going to be a gentle process&#8217;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Chancellor of the Exchequer has previously been very critical of the IMF. </b></p>
<p>In April 2014, the Chancellor made a speech to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/chancellors-speech-to-the-american-enterprise-institute" target="_blank">American Enterprise Institute</a> which was widely perceived to be a direct attack on the IMF for its previous negative forecasts about the British economy. Mr Osborne said: &#8216;pessimistic predictions that fiscal consolidation was incompatible with economic recovery have been proved comprehensively wrong by events&#8230; many of those same pessimists have now found new grounds to be gloomy about our future&#8230; I want to explain why I believe both of these predictions will be proved wrong too&#8230; I have a different prescription. My message today at the IMF is this. The pessimists said our plan would not deliver economic growth. Now they say economic growth will not deliver higher living standards. <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/58bbf198-c0d4-11e3-8578-00144feabdc0.html#axzz45S5uv2r3" target="_blank">They were wrong about the past and they are now wrong about the future</a>&#8216;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The IMF is wrong about the effect of leaving the EU on the current account. This undermines all its subsequent predictions about the impact of a vote to leave the EU.</b></p>
<p>The IMF argues that it would be more difficult to finance the current account deficit in the event of a vote to leave the EU. The UK recorded a current account deficit of <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/balanceofpayments/bulletins/balanceofpayments/octtodecandannual2015/pdf" target="_blank">£96.3 billion</a> in 2015.</p>
<p>The current account <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=/economy/nationalaccounts/balanceofpayments/compendium/unitedkingdombalanceofpaymentsthepinkbook/2015-10-30/unitedkingdombalanceofpaymentsthepinkbook/pinkbook2015chapter9_tcm77-422053.xls" target="_blank">deficit could be substantially reduced if we Vote Leave</a>. In 2014 (the last year for which data are available) the UK recorded a £12.3 billion balance of payments deficit with the EU institutions. ONS figures released in <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/balanceofpayments/bulletins/balanceofpayments/octtodecandannual2015/pdf" target="_blank">March 2015</a> show the UK Government paid the EU institutions (net) £10.6 billion in 2015 (this figure excludes payments by the private sector to the EU institutions).</p>
<p>This means we could substantially cut the current account deficit if we Vote Leave.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.oxfordeconomics.com/brexit/executive-summary" target="_blank">EU-funded Oxford Economics group</a> has concluded that if the UK voted to leave the EU, &#8216;in most cases (five out of nine), the UK&#8217;s trade balance improves&#8217;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The IMF is wrong that the prospect of leaving the EU &#8216;already appears to be having an impact on investment and hiring decisions&#8217;.</b></p>
<p>The Bank of England stated yesterday that &#8216;i<a href="http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/inflationreport/2016/may.pdf#page=13" target="_blank">nterest rates appear to have moved little in response to referendum-related news</a>&#8216; and that there is an &#8216;absence of a clear effect on interest rates&#8230; The impact of the referendum on equity prices is also difficult to quantify&#8217; and that there is nothing to &#8216;suggest any clear referendum impact&#8217;.</p>
<p>The IMF even attributes recent trends in the commercial real estate market to the EU referendum. This is despite the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England&#8217;s admission yesterday that it was &#8216;<a href="http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/minutes/Documents/mpc/pdf/2016/may.pdf#page=5" target="_blank">unclear</a>&#8216; to what extent property transactions were being affected by the referendum.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/minutes/Documents/mpc/pdf/2016/apr.pdf#page=8" target="_blank">The Bank of England</a> has said there is: &#8216;little evidence across the range of indicators that&#8230; uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the referendum on the UK&#8217;s membership of the EU had much affected job creation&#8217;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The IMF&#8217;s claim that the largest risk to the economy is the EU referendum is contradicted by the Bank of England.</b></p>
<p>The Governor of the Bank of England has said that &#8216;the global risks, including from <a href="http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/treasury-committee/the-economic-and-financial-costs-and-benefits-of-uks-eu-membership/oral/30246.pdf" target="_blank">China</a> are bigger than the domestic risk [of the referendum]&#8217;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The IMF is wrong about house prices.</b></p>
<p>The IMF is <strong>wrong</strong> to claim that leaving the EU &#8216;could entail sharp drops in equity and house prices&#8217;.</p>
<p>Philip Shaw, Chief Economist at Investec Bank, has said: &#8216;I don&#8217;t necessarily see a massive impact on house prices. In the UK domestic property market, the biggest driver is<a href="http://www.mortgagesolutions.co.uk/news/2016/03/07/brexit-unlikely-to-have-massive-impact-on-uk-house-prices/" target="_blank"> demographics and regulation</a>&#8216;. He has also claimed interest rates could be cut, stating that &#8216;is a risk&#8217;.</p>
<p>The Council of Mortgage Lenders has said: &#8216;As a relatively small, open economy and a major financial centre, the <a href="https://www.mortgagestrategy.co.uk/how-would-a-brexit-affect-the-mortgage-market/" target="_blank">UK has, and will continue to have, close links with global economies, including those within the EU</a>. There is no simple answer to the question of how Brexit might affect housing and mortgage markets&#8217;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Government has said the IMF is wrong that &#8216;ratification of a new deal would require unanimous consent of all EU member governments&#8217;.</b></p>
<p>A withdrawal agreement under <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1459185432432&amp;uri=CELEX:12012M050" target="_blank">article 50</a> of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) is subject to qualified majority voting, not unanimity in the EU Council.</p>
<p>As the Government has acknowledged, &#8216;The final agreement would need to be agreed by both parties: the EU side and the departing Member State. On the EU side, this would require an enhanced qualified majority among the remaining Member States. This means that <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/503908/54538_EU_Series_No2_Accessible.pdf#page=10" target="_blank">no single Member State could veto the deal</a>&#8216;.</p>
<p>Even if a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/503908/54538_EU_Series_No2_Accessible.pdf#page=15" target="_blank">separate</a> deal to the withdrawal agreement were required (a point on which there is some legal uncertainty), the Government has admitted that: &#8216;an agreement focused solely on trade would need to be approved by the European Parliament and a qualified majority of the Council&#8217;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The IMF is wrong about the future nature of the UK&#8217;s relationship with the EU &#8211; as the IN campaign has acknowledged.</b></p>
<p>The IMF claims that a &#8216;vote to leave the EU would create <strong>uncertainty</strong> about the nature of the UK&#8217;s long-term economic relationship with the EU and the rest of the world&#8217;. <strong>This is wrong</strong>.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister, David Cameron, has admitted: &#8216;If we were outside the EU altogether, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/060113.pdf" target="_blank">we&#8217;d still be trading with all these European countries, of course we would</a> &#8230; Of course the trading would go on &#8230; There&#8217;s a lot of scaremongering on all sides of this debate. Of course the trading would go on&#8217;.</p>
<p>The UK&#8217;s former Ambassador to the EU and leading supporter of the BSE campaign, Lord Kerr of Kinlochard, has admitted: &#8216;<a href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com/lords/?id=2015-11-02a.1492.2" target="_blank">there is no doubt that the UK could secure a free trade agreement with the EU. That is not an issue</a>&#8216;.</p>
<p>Even the pro-EU CBI has said: &#8216;the <a href="http://news.cbi.org.uk/reports/our-global-future/our-global-future/#page=152" target="_blank">UK is highly likely to secure a Free Trade Agreement with the EU</a>, and such an agreement would be likely to be negotiated at an extremely high level of ambition relative to other FTAs [free trade agreements]&#8217;.</p>
<p>The pro-EU Centre for European Reform has accepted that, &#8216;given the importance of the UK market to the eurozone, the <a href="http://www.cer.org.uk/sites/default/files/publications/attachments/pdf/2014/report_smc_final_report_june2014-9013.pdf#page=33" target="_blank">UK would probably have little difficulty in negotiating an FTA</a>&#8216;.</p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary, Philip Hammond, has admitted that a free trade agreement in goods &#8216;would be relatively <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmhansrd/cm160225/debtext/160225-0002.htm" target="_blank">simple to negotiate</a>&#8216;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The IMF is wrong that London&#8217;s status as a global financial centre could be &#8216;eroded&#8217; due to a loss of passporting rights.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Switzerland exports a higher proportion of financial services to the EU, despite an absence of passporting rights for its banks.</i> The OECD has noted that: &#8216;the <a href="http://www.oecd.org/eco/The-Economic-consequences-of-Brexit-27-april-2016.pdf#page=15" target="_blank">EU absorbs around 45% of Swiss exports of financial services, despite the absence of passporting rights for its banks</a>&#8216;. In 2014, exports to the EU of financial services, insurance and pensions represented <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/bop/united-kingdom-balance-of-payments/2015/pdf-reference-tables.pdf" target="_blank">33% of the UK&#8217;s exports in those sectors</a>.</b></p>
<p>Mutual recognition agreements could be agreed if we Vote Leave. The Government has <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/504661/Alternatives_to_membership_possible_models_for_the_UK_outside_the_EU_Accessible.pdf#page=24" target="_blank">admitted</a>: &#8216;the EU has &#8220;equivalence regimes&#8221; to allow financial services firms outside the EU to trade with the Single Market in a way that is similar to the EU financial services passport. It does this through assessing whether a country&#8217;s regulatory regime is equivalent to EU rules in the area&#8217;. The <a href="http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2016/february/tradoc_154329.pdf#page=13" target="_blank">EU-Canada free trade agreement</a> contains a chapter on financial services.</p>
<p>It is in the EU&#8217;s interests to continue to secure access to the world&#8217;s largest capital market. As the Governor of the Bank of England, Dr Mark Carney, has said: &#8216;<a href="http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/treasury-committee/the-economic-and-financial-costs-and-benefits-of-uks-eu-membership/oral/30246.pdf" target="_blank">The comment I would make is that mutual recognition arrangements are possible to achieve</a>&#8216;. There is no prospect of EU Governments wanting to restrict the access of their banks to the City of London.</p>
<p>As the Chairman of the IN/BSE campaign, Lord Rose of Monewden has said: &#8216;<a href="http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/treasury-committee/the-economic-and-financial-costs-and-benefits-of-uks-eu-membership/oral/30171.pdf" target="_blank">We are very good at what we do in terms of financial services. They cannot do without us</a>&#8216;. It will be in the interests of EU negotiators for the UK to retain &#8216;passporting&#8217; rights, as key European firms &#8216;passport&#8217; their services into London.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/pra/Documents/authorisations/banklist/banklist1509.pdf#page=4" target="_blank">Bank of England</a>, in September 2015, 75 banks located in the European Economic Area &#8216;passported&#8217; their services into the UK, including ABN AMRO, BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank and Société Générale. In addition, almost <a href="http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/pra/Documents/insurancelisteea1507.pdf" target="_blank">800 insurance firms in the EEA</a> could passport their services into the UK as of July 2015.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The European Commission has already announced it intends to silence the UK&#8217;s voice in the IMF.</b></p>
<p>The EU&#8217;s blueprint for further integration and future Treaty change, the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/priorities/sites/beta-political/files/5-presidents-report_en.pdf#page=17" target="_blank"><i>Five Presidents&#8217; Report</i></a>, calls for common EU representation &#8216;in the international financial institutions&#8217; rather than letting individual member states speak for themselves. It suggests that the EU&#8217;s &#8216;fragmented voice means the EU is punching below its political and economic weight&#8217; and specifically singles out the IMF as one such example.</p>
<p>In October 2015, the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52015PC0603&amp;from=EN#page=10" target="_blank">European Commission</a> proposed a Council Decision to establish unified representation of the euro area in the IMF. The draft Decision, on which the UK will not have a vote, states that: &#8216;Close cooperation with non-euro area Member States shall be organised within the Council and the [Economic and Financial Committee], on matters related to the IMF. Common positions shall be coordinated on matters relevant for the European Union as a whole&#8217;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The European Parliament has voted for the UK to be silenced in the IMF last month.</b></p>
<p>In April, the <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=TA&amp;reference=P8-TA-2016-0108&amp;language=EN&amp;ring=A8-2016-0027" target="_blank">European Parliament</a> called for the EU to &#8216;seek full membership of international economic and financial institutions where this has not yet been granted and is appropriate (e.g. in the cases of the OECD and the IMF)&#8217;.</p>
<p>The Parliament demanded that there should be &#8216;a single European Union constituency in the long term&#8217;, with voting in the EU Council &#8216;<a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=TA&amp;reference=P8-TA-2016-0108&amp;language=EN&amp;ring=A8-2016-0027" target="_blank">moving away from consensus to a weighted majority voting system</a>&#8216;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The European Court will force this through.</b></p>
<p>In an October 2014 decision, the European Court ruled, <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:62012CJ0399" target="_blank">rejecting</a> the UK&#8217;s arguments, that the EU may require the UK to adopt a common EU position in an international organisation of which the EU is not a member, provided that the subject matter of the decision relates to an EU legislative competence. As a result, the UK was forced to adopt an EU common position in International Organisation of Vine and Wine.</p>
<p>Since the EU has legislative competence over financial services, the <strong>UK could be forced to adopt a common EU line in the IMF whenever the EU wants.</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Responding to the publication of national insurance number registration statistics by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), Employment Minister Priti Patel said:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8216;These figures &#8211; which had to be dragged out of the government &#8211; show the scale and impact of immigration from the EU is even higher than previously admitted. It is out of control &#8211; and cannot be controlled as long as we stay in the EU. This puts huge strains on the NHS, housing, schools and other public services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8216;Short term migration is highly significant, and arguably most damaging in terms of wages and work conditions. The only way we can take back control, and deliver on our manifesto commitment to reduce migration is to Vote Leave on 23 June.&#8217;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/internationalmigration/articles/noteonthedifferencebetweennationalinsurancenumberregistrationsandtheestimateoflongterminternationalmigration/2016" target="_blank">Office for National Statistics (ONS)</a> has released a note on the difference between National Insurance number registrations and the estimate of long-term international migration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>These statistics do show that the International Passenger Survey is underestimating the scale of migration into the UK.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">In the four years ending June 2014, there were 739,000 gross EU migrants according to the International Passenger Survey (IPS). There were <strong><a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/internationalmigration/articles/noteonthedifferencebetweennationalinsurancenumberregistrationsandtheestimateoflongterminternationalmigration/2016/c4615968.xls" target="_blank">1.537 million</a></strong> NI no. registrations.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The ONS states that: &#8216;HMRC also shared with us analysis of those who had arrived, or registered for a NINo in the 4 years, to 2013-14 and were subject to income tax NICs and, or received HMRC benefits at some point in 2013/14 – the latest year available. They found <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/internationalmigration/articles/noteonthedifferencebetweennationalinsurancenumberregistrationsandtheestimateoflongterminternationalmigration/2016">1.0 million</a> such individuals were from the EEA&#8217;.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Even accounting for short-term migration, this suggests that there is a <a href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/mro/news-release/census-result-shows-increase-in-population-of-the-north-east/censusnortheastnr0712.html" target="_blank">261,000</a> disparity between the IPS and the true level of long-term migration, the equivalent of a city the size of Newcastle.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/UK-IMMIGRATION-e1463129461256.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-18779"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-18779" src="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/UK-IMMIGRATION-1024x681.jpg" alt="Arrivals from the European Union customs channel at Stansted Airport, England, Britain UK" width="640" height="426" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>The figures reveal the high-level of short term migration, which has a corrosive impact on people&#8217;s wages and rental prices.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The report states that: &#8216;Short-term migration to the UK largely accounts for the recent differences between the number of long-term migrants (as estimated by the International Passenger Survey (IPS)) and the number of National Insurance number (NINo) registrations for EU citizens&#8217;. This confirms that EU migrants who are coming to the UK for short periods are registering for work, putting a <strong>downward pressure on wages</strong>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It is well established that having more people in the workforce drives down wages. The Bank of England has found that &#8216;the immigrant to native ratio has a small <a href="http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/research/Documents/workingpapers/2015/swp574.pdf#page=2" target="_blank">negative impact on average British wage</a>&#8216;. The study found that &#8216;immigrants in recent years are most predominant in <a href="http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/research/Documents/workingpapers/2015/swp574.pdf#page=2" target="_blank">low-skill</a> occupations&#8217;. The study concluded that: &#8216;the biggest effect is in the semi/unskilled services sector, where a 10 percentage point rise in the proportion of immigrants is associated with a <a href="http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/research/Documents/workingpapers/2015/swp574.pdf#page=23" target="_blank">2 percent reduction in pay</a>&#8216;.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The head of the BSE campaign, Lord Rose acknowledged this and admitted <a href="http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/treasury-committee/the-economic-and-financial-costs-and-benefits-of-uks-eu-membership/oral/30171.pdf#page=35" target="_blank">wages will go up&#8217; if we Vote Leave</a>, stating: &#8216;If you are short of labour, the price of labour will go up&#8217;.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>The report concludes that the Government does not understand the nature of migrants who enter and leave the UK several times a year.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The report concludes that &#8216;more analysis will take place to <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/internationalmigration/articles/noteonthedifferencebetweennationalinsurancenumberregistrationsandtheestimateoflongterminternationalmigration/2016" target="_blank">better understand</a> what administrative sources tell us about migration patterns, particularly migrants who may enter and leave the UK several times within a year&#8217;.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>The Government has failed to reduce net migration to the tens of thousands, despite the Prime Minister and the Home Secretary&#8217;s repeated promises.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The 2010 Conservative Manifesto <a href="https://www.conservatives.com/%7E/media/files/activist%20centre/press%20and%20policy/manifestos/manifesto2010" target="_blank">promised</a> that &#8216;we will take steps to take net migration back to the levels of the 1990s – tens of thousands a year, not hundreds of thousands&#8217;.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In his <a href="http://press.conservatives.com/post/98882674910/david-cameron-speech-to-conservative-party" target="_blank">2014 conference speech</a>, Cameron said: &#8216;numbers that have increased faster than we in this country wanted at a level that was too much for our communities, for our labour markets. All of this has to change – and it will be at the very heart of my renegotiation strategy for Europe. Britain, I know you want this sorted so I will go to Brussels, I will not take no for an answer and when it comes to free movement – I will get what Britain needs&#8217;.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>The 2015 Conservative Manifesto <a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/manifesto2015/ConservativeManifesto2015.pdf#page=31" target="_blank">promised</a> to &#8216;keep our ambition of delivering annual net migration in the tens of thousands, not the hundreds of thousands&#8217;.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">In her 2015 conference speech, the Home Secretary, Theresa May, said: &#8216;<a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/theresa-may-s-speech-to-the-conservative-party-conference-in-full-a6681901.html" target="_blank">Britain does not need net migration in the hundreds of thousands every year</a>&#8230; at best the net economic and fiscal effect of high immigration is close to zero.  So there is no case, in the national interest, for immigration of the scale we have experienced over the last decade.Neither is it true that, in the modern world, immigration is no longer possible to control&#8217;.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The lowest net migration has been since 2010 was 177,000 in 2012. Net migration in 2014 was <a href="http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/HTMLDocs/dvc123/data14.xls" target="_blank">313,000</a>, of which 174,000 persons came from the EU.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>The Government has dropped a key promise that EU migrants must have a job offer to come to the UK.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">In November 2014, the Prime Minister <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/jcb-staffordshire-prime-ministers-speech" target="_blank">promised</a> that &#8216;we want EU jobseekers to have a job offer before they come here&#8217;.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Home Secretary, Theresa May, has argued: &#8216;when it was first enshrined, free movement meant the freedom to move to a job, <a href="http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/world_news/article1600014.ece" target="_blank">not the freedom to cross borders to look for work</a>&#8230; we must take some big decisions, face down powerful interests and reinstate the original principle underlying free movement within the EU&#8217;.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, has said: &#8216;What we&#8217;re going to address is this question of how freedom of movement operates in the 21st century. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/03/george-osborne-downplays-difference-germany-eu-freedom-movement" target="_blank">It was never envisaged that you would have such large numbers of people coming, people coming who don&#8217;t have job offers</a>&#8216;.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The renegotiation agreement notes that EU citizens are &#8216;<a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/meetings/european-council/2016/02/EUCO-Conclusions_pdf/" target="_blank">entitled to reside</a>&#8230; [in the UK] solely because of their job-search&#8217;.</p>
<p dir="ltr">ONS statistics (which are likely to be an underestimate) show that in the year ending September 2015, <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/internationalmigration/bulletins/migrationstatisticsquarterlyreport/february2016/7f57ba2c.xls" target="_blank">69,000 EU citizens</a> entered the UK &#8216;looking for work&#8217;. If the number of EU jobseekers entering the UK over the next decade remains at current levels, 690,000 persons would be added to the UK population as a direct result. This would be the equivalent of a <a href="http://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/files/statistics/council-area-data-sheets/glasgow-city-factsheet.pdf" target="_blank">city the size of Glasgow</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/jobc-e1463129146886.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-18777"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18777" src="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/jobc-e1463129146886.jpg" alt="jobcentre" width="640" height="401" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>The Government has dropped a key promise that all EU jobseekers must leave the UK after six months.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">In November 2014, the Prime Minister promised that &#8216;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/jcb-staffordshire-prime-ministers-speech" target="_blank">if an EU jobseeker has not found work within six months, they will be required to leave</a>&#8216;.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:61989CJ0292" target="_blank">This is illegal under EU law</a>. In 1991, the European Court ruled that the Treaties forbid the removal of jobseekers from another EU member state, regardless of the duration of their stay if &#8216;the person concerned provides evidence that he is continuing to seek employment and that he has genuine chances of being engaged&#8217;.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Government admitted in December that many <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-question/Commons/2015-11-25/17574/" target="_blank">EU migrants</a> can &#8216;keep the status of jobseeker for longer than six months&#8217;.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/immigration-e1463129250254.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-18778"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-18778" src="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/immigration-1024x768.jpg" alt="immigration" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>The &#8217;emergency brake&#8217; will have no impact on migration.</strong></p>
<p>In December, one of the top three members of the independent Office for Budget Responsibility, Sir Stephen Nickell CBE, has said changes to migration would have &#8216;<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35043070" target="_blank">not much&#8217; impact on migration</a>.</p>
<p>Oxford University&#8217;s Migration Observatory concluded that the proposed welfare reforms are &#8216;<a href="http://www.migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/sites/files/migobs/Report-EU_Migration_Welfare_Benefits.pdf" target="_blank">unlikely</a>&#8216; to &#8216;lead to a large reduction in EU migration to the UK&#8217;.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>Brexit the movie, is a clearly defined analysis of the EU project and delves deeply into the dark world of the monolithic faceless EU technocratic structure.</p>
<p>The EU is a machine, it processes nations, strips them of their sovereignty, cleans out the innards of financial institutions of those former nations, and amalgamates the spoils into one singular EU black hole where the pampered MEPs and faceless eurocrats eat their caviar,  guzzle on champagne, and chuckle to themselves as they peruse the overblown pay cheque which just landed on their laps courtesy of the taxpayer.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em><strong>&#8220;We decide on something, leave it lying around, and wait and see what happens. If no one kicks up a fuss, because most people don&#8217;t understand what has been decided, we continue step by step until there is no turning back.&#8221;</strong>  EU President, Jean Claude Juncker</em></p>
<p>In relative terms, Britain has its last chance before it is unceremoniously eviscerated once and for all. Betrayed by part of the population who were fooled by the scaremongering, or just too lazy to find out the real facts; the EUs technique of control relies on the populace of a nation betraying their own countrymen to take over. This we call mind control, and the EU is very effective at mass indoctrination, provokatsiya, zakazukha within the education system and propaganda filled controlled media.</p>
<p>The EU does not stand for democracy and its MEPs revel in this unaccountability, it gives them free reign to do as they please, whilst enjoying the spoils of the taxpayer cash cows.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em><strong>“If it&#8217;s a Yes, we will say &#8216;on we go&#8217;, and if it&#8217;s a No we will say &#8216;we continue’,”</strong> EU President, Jean Claude Juncker</em></p>
<p>To punish Britain is to vote to stay in such a totalitarian entity, where freedom of speech will dissolve completely, where there will be no choice, there will be no mercy to the proletariat, just a cold boot in the face.</p>
<p>George Orwell would have understood the EU very well, as would Karl Marx, and Josef Stalin. Merkel, the current head of the Germanic empirical EU was trained in East Germany under the communist regime, and she is now head of a communist soviet entity called the EU.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong><em>&#8220;There can be no democratic choice against the European treaties.&#8221; </em></strong><em>EU President, Jean Claude Juncker</em></p>
<p>When the EU army grows further in strength, your children, and your grandchildren will pledge allegiance to the EU flag as they are conscripted to fight on the Russian front. The Bundeswehr, will eagerly accept your sons and daughters to be used as cannon fodder, to have their blood spilled across the Siberian snow, or to freeze to death, their bodies left to rot amongst the other EU conscripts.</p>
<p>We dare you to vote to remain in the EU, a monstrous evil entity that abhors any form of democracy, and resembles the Borg with its assimilation of all into the behemoth of Baal. Brexit is the only answer.</p>

<p>The biased pro-EU BBC received £2 million from the EU just before the announcement of the referendum. Goldman Sachs, Citi bank, Lloyds and JP Morgan are putting vast sums of money into the campaign. The Project Fear daily announcements spouting &#8216;fearful&#8217; false propaganda headlines. The PM&#8217;s announcement that there were no Brexit plans by the government early in the campaign reveal that the EU referendum was from the start a completely skewed unfair playing field.</p>
<p>The final icing on the cake is David Cameron choosing his live TV debate partner, and shying away from the official Leave Campaign representative who could cause real damage to his flawed fearmongering campaign.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ltAtUTlm29w?list=PLxmmqnJBgiEBwrMoskhQaIOamCgM_aOvL" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>No Level Playing Field</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Commenting on ITV&#8217;s decision to allow the Prime Minister to decide his opponent in the referendum TV debates, a Vote Leave official spokesman said:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8216;The Government has set all the rules for the referendum to give itself every possible advantage. It has also demanded of the broadcasters that the Prime Minister should not have to debate representatives from the official Leave campaign.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8216;ITV has accepted the Prime Minister&#8217;s demands without even discussing it with the official campaign and has allowed the Prime Minister to dictate his own opponent. Since the campaign began, ITV has also given twice as much airtime to the IN campaign than to the Leave campaign.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8216;We think that the Prime Minister ought to debate the representative of the official Leave campaign. In a serious democracy, the Government should not be allowed by a free media to pick its own opponents in the official debates on the most important political decision in decades.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8216;We are discussing <strong>legal possibilities</strong> to increase the chances that the public will hear the issues properly discussed before they make such an important vote on the future of their democratic rights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8216;The reason for the timing of the announcement is the Government&#8217;s desire to <strong>distract attention from the immigration figures being released today</strong>. We hope that ITV covers that story properly.&#8217;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Today, the Electoral Commission <a href="http://search.electoralcommission.org.uk/Search/Donations?currentPage=1&amp;rows=10&amp;sort=Value&amp;order=desc&amp;tab=1&amp;open=filter&amp;et=perpar&amp;date=Reported&amp;from=2016-04-01&amp;to=2016-05-03&amp;prePoll=true&amp;postPoll=false&amp;optCols=AccountingUnitsAsCentralParty&amp;optCols=IsSponsorship&amp;optCols=RegulatedDoneeType&amp;optCols=CompanyRegistrationNumber&amp;optCols=Postcode&amp;optCols=NatureOfDonation&amp;optCols=PurposeOfVisit&amp;optCols=DonationAction&amp;optCols=ReportedDate&amp;optCols=IsReportedPrePoll&amp;optCols=ReportingPeriodName&amp;optCols=IsBequest&amp;optCols=IsAggregation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">published details</a> of donations and loans to the EU referendum campaigns.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Just four donors to the Britain Stronger in Europe (BSE) campaign, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley and Citi, have had to pay a total of <strong>$27.7 billion</strong> to the US Government for their role in causing the global financial crisis in 2008.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The US Government had stated that all of these banks contributed to the financial crisis by misselling toxic mortgages. Goldman Sachs also cooked the books to allow Greece to join the single currency.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">In 2015, the four banks spent collectively as much as €5.25 million lobbying the European Commission. Each bank spent at least €1 million.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan were supportive of the UK&#8217;s entry into the single currency, as was Citi&#8217;s current Chief Economist who predicted Greece would leave the euro by 1 January 2013.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Lloyds Bank Plc (which had to be bailed out by the taxpayer and was involved in the LIBOR) has lent the BSE campaign £20,000 at just 1% interest.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The BSE campaign has also accepted donations from companies which are majority owned by foreign governments, companies based offshore, a company owned by a Russian oligarch linked to &#8216;a campaign of state-sponsored harassment&#8217; and supporters of and donors to the pro-euro campaign fifteen years ago.</p>
</li>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Commenting, former Labour Foreign Secretary Lord Owen said:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8216;The EU works in the interests of the elite &#8211; the one per cent &#8211; so it is entirely unsurprising to find that the campaign to keep us in the Union is financed by big banks like Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8216;With their unlimited cash, they are lobbying the British people to act in a way that benefits their profit margin. Remember, these banks are the very people who crashed the economy in 2008 &#8211; misselling toxic mortgages, and cooking the books to allow Greece to join the single currency. Millions of ordinary people paid for their mistakes &#8211; and many are still suffering.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8216;The truth is that Wall Street&#8217;s predatory habits have played an important, although little recognised, role in the Eurozone crisis. Yet, today, Goldman Sachs have the brass cheek to lecture us in the UK on why we should stay in an EU damaged and rendered virtually dysfunctional by the Eurozone crisis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8216;These figures show again that we are in a David vs Goliath fight, but it is one we are determined to win &#8211; for the good of the British people. They are the ones who pay the costs of uncontrolled migration &#8211; through lower wages, and unsustainable pressure on public services such as schools and hospitals. Now is the opportunity for them to strike back &#8211; and reclaim control of the £350 million we send to the EU every week, to spend it on their priorities instead.&#8217;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Goldman Sachs campaigned for the single currency.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Peter Sutherland, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030524124418/http://www.britainineurope.org/templ.phtml?id=1c" target="_blank">Chief Executive of Goldman Sachs International</a> sat on the Council of Britain in Europe, the failed campaign to scrap the pound and to ratify the European Constitution.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Mr Sutherland was a vocal supporter of the single currency: &#8216;[F]ormer European commissioner Peter Sutherland, who is now chairman of the investment bank Goldman Sachs International. Mr Sutherland said it had been a tragedy that Britain had stood apart during the early formative years of European integration and had often appeared to be a semi-detached participant in the process. &#8220;An opt-out from the single currency will exacerbate the impression and the reality of this detachment and inevitably will reduce the influence of Britain at a time of fundamental change both within Europe and globally,&#8221; he added. &#8220;It is surely essential that the United Kingdom should seek to advance its influence and the irony is that British influence over its own destiny in all economic areas, including currency, is enhanced rather than eroded by pooling sovereignty&#8221;&#8216; (Press Association, 12 November 1996).</p>

At some point the so-called cross currency swaps will mature, and swell the country&#8217;s already bloated deficit&#8217;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Goldman Sachs was a major cause of the financial crisis.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">In 2016, Goldman Sachs reached a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/goldman-sachs-agrees-pay-more-5-billion-connection-its-sale-residential-mortgage-backed" target="_blank">settlement </a>with the US Government under which it paid $5.06 billion &#8216;related to Goldman&#8217;s conduct in the packaging, securitization, marketing, sale and issuance of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) between 2005 and 2007.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Associate United States Attorney General Stuart F.

<p dir="ltr">The Vice Chairman, Investment Banking at JPMorgan, Lord Renwick of Clifton was a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030524124418/http://www.britainineurope.org/templ.phtml?id=1c" target="_blank">member of the Council of Britain in Europe</a>, the failed campaign to scrap the pound and to ratify the European Constitution.</p>
<p dir="ltr">JPMorgan <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2000/jul/01/9" target="_blank">warned </a>the UK could be left &#8216;<strong>isolated</strong>&#8216; outside the <strong>&#8216;single currency</strong>&#8216;: &#8216;This time round, as the investment bank JP Morgan noted yesterday: &#8220;A &#8216;yes&#8217; vote could leave the UK isolated as the only one of the 15 European Union members without a clear timetable for entry&#8217;&#8230; As the JP Morgan analysis notes, if that happened: &#8220;Investors are unlikely to react positively to the rejection of the single currency by a country that has been a member of the EU for 27 years, with a fixed exchange rate for 18 years&#8217;.</p>
<p dir="ltr">JPMorgan claimed that staying out of the &#8216;single currency&#8217; would lead to banks relocating to the rest of the EU: &#8216;Despite all this, JP Morgan does not see &#8220;Project 1992&#8221; as the real threat to London. Potentially more dangerous is the distant prospect of a single currency and central bank. JP Morgan argues that financial business would be likely to gravitate to the place where such a central bank operated, although policy-making could be split from the operations &#8211; as the US Federal Reserve is divided between Washington and New York. At least JP Morgan reckons London has a fair claim to be the operating centre&#8217; (Independent, 20 September 1988).</p>

<p dir="ltr">The United States Attorney General Eric Holder said: &#8216;the conduct uncovered in this investigation helped sow the seeds of the mortgage meltdown&#8217;, and said JPMorgan had &#8216;<a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-federal-and-state-partners-secure-record-13-billion-global-settlement" target="_blank">knowingly bundle[d] toxic loans and [sold] them to unsuspecting investors</a>&#8216;.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Associate Attorney General Tony West said the bank &#8216;helped create a financial storm&#8217; and that &#8216;the conduct JPMorgan has acknowledged &#8211; packaging risky home loans into securities, then selling them without disclosing their low quality to investors &#8211; <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-federal-and-state-partners-secure-record-13-billion-global-settlement" target="_blank">contributed to the wreckage of the financial crisis</a>&#8216;.</p>

<p dir="ltr">In July 2014, Citigroup entered into a $7 billion settlement with the US Department of Justice &#8216;<a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-federal-and-state-partners-secure-record-7-billion-global-settlement" target="_blank">for Misleading Investors About Securities Containing Toxic Mortgages</a>&#8216;.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The US Attorney General, Eric Holder, said: &#8216;<a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-federal-and-state-partners-secure-record-7-billion-global-settlement" target="_blank">The bank&#8217;s activities contributed mightily to the financial crisis that devastated our economy in 2008</a>&#8216;.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Associate Attorney General Tony West said the bank had &#8216;<a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-federal-and-state-partners-secure-record-7-billion-global-settlement" target="_blank">a contributing role in creating the financial crisis</a>&#8216;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Citi spends millions lobbying the EU.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">In 2015, Citi <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/transparencyregister/public/consultation/displaylobbyist.do?id=00353757573-57" target="_blank">spent</a> between €1,000,000 and €1,249,999 lobbying the European Commission.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Citi&#8217;s chief economist was a fanatical advocate of the UK scrapping the pound and has made many false predictions in the past.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Citigroup&#8217;s Global Chief Economist is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/willembuiter" target="_blank">Willem H. Buiter</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In August 2002, Buiter co-wrote a paper entitled &#8216;<a href="http://willembuiter.com/RL334D.pdf" target="_blank">Why Britain should join the euro</a>&#8216;. It argued that &#8216;Joining the euro would increase our incomes and thus our standard of living&#8217;.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Buiter also claimed remaining outside the single currency would &#8216;damage to London&#8217;s position as an international financial centre&#8217; and lead to &#8216;second fiddle status in the political concert of Europe&#8217; (The Independent, 3 July 1998, p. 19).</p>
<p dir="ltr">In May 2012, Citi <a href="http://www.france24.com/en/20120524-europe-crucial-moment-ecb-president-draghi-cautions-eurozone-crisis-deepens-euro" target="_blank">predicted </a>Greece would leave the eurozone by 1 January 2013.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Morgan Stanley played a major part in causing the global financial crisis.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">In February 2016, Morgan Stanley paid a penalty of $2.6 billion to the US Government</p>
<p dir="ltr">Acting Associate Attorney General Stuart F. Delery said the bank had engaged in &#8216;misleading investors about the subprime mortgage loans underlying the securities it sold&#8217;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Benjamin C. Mizer said the bank was among &#8216;those who contributed to the financial crisis of 2008&#8217; (US Department of Justice, 11 February 2016, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/morgan-stanley-agrees-pay-26-billion-penalty-connection-its-sale-residential-mortgage-backed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">link</a>).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Morgan Stanley spent millions lobbying the EU.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">In 2015, Morgan Stanley <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/transparencyregister/public/consultation/displaylobbyist.do?id=29701922039-63" target="_blank">spent </a>between €1,000,000 and €1,249,999 lobbying the European Commission.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Lloyds supported the Exchange Rate Mechanism and scrapping the pound.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Lloyds was a member of the Association for the Monetary Union of Europe, which was established &#8216;as a voice for Europe&#8217;s business community expressing the need for monetary stability and a single European currency&#8217; (Investors Chronicle, 6 December 1991, p.14).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Lloyds called for the UK to rejoin the Exchange Rate Mechanism in 1993, as a prelude to scrapping the pound. Lloyds&#8217; Chief Economist, Patrick Foley, claimed that: &#8216;It would make it easier and more attractive for countries such as Italy and the UK to rejoin the system&#8230; The advantage of rebuilding the ERM is that it would allow the EC to move towards a single currency which would make the operation of the European single market more effective&#8217; (Press Association, 21 June 1993).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Mr Foley later claimed that: &#8216;Prices of goods would come down&#8217; if the pound were scrapped and that &#8216;sovereignty over monetary policy would be a good thing for the British government to lose&#8217; (Sunday Times, 4 February 1996).</p>
<p dir="ltr">More recently, Lloyds has <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/britain-eu-lloyds-idUKL5N17H48V" target="_blank">warned </a>against a referendum stating that it could lead to &#8216;uncertainty&#8217;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Lloyds was heavily involved in the 2008 financial crisis and had to be bailed out to the tune of billions by the taxpayer.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">In 2008, Lloyds/HBOS had to receive a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7666570.stm" target="_blank">Government bailout of £17 billion</a>. The Government acquired a 40% stake in the bank.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As part of its efforts to <a href="https://www.nao.org.uk/highlights/taxpayer-support-for-uk-banks-faqs/" target="_blank">recapitalise</a> Lloyds Banking Group, the Government ended up acquiring 41% of Lloyds shares.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Lloyds was implicated in the LIBOR scandal in 2014 and was fined hundreds of millions for &#8216;manipulation&#8217;.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">In July 2014, Lloyds was fined £218m for <strong>&#8216;serious misconduct</strong>&#8216; over the setting of interest rates in London.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission said that Lloyds <a href="http://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/pr6966-14" target="_blank">manipulated</a> the London interbank offered rate (Libor) for yen and sterling and tried to rig the rate for yen, sterling and the US dollar.</p>

Of course, some would say they never intended to make keys available&#8230;. These economic imbalances, and the respective sets of cultural values that gave birth to them are, in my view, so intractable that it is very hard to see any solution that is truly sustainable over the long term&#8217;.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Responding</strong> to Gordon Brown&#8217;s speech at the London School of Economics today, <strong>Leader of the House of Commons Chris Grayling</strong> said:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Gordon Brown&#8217;s EU policies when he was in office were a disaster. He gave away huge amounts of money to the EU when they cut our rebate, he broke his promise to hold a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty and he gave away many new powers to Brussels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;The EU is undermining our ability to stop multinational companies milking our tax system. We face tens of billions of pounds of liabilities in the next few years because EU judges have ruled in favour of big corporates instead of UK taxpayers. That is on top of the £350 million we hand over to the EU every week, money which would be better spent on our priorities here like the NHS.&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Gordon Brown broke promises on the EU when he was Prime Minister and was a disaster to the UK&#8217;s economy. He cannot be trusted.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7141279.stm" target="_blank">Brown signed the Lisbon Treaty</a> (which was almost identical to the European Constitution) on 13 December 2007. This was despite a promise in the <a href="http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/wmatrix/tutorial/labour%20manifesto%202005.pdf" target="_blank">2005 Labour Manifesto</a> that &#8216;We will put it [the Constitution] to the British people in a referendum&#8217;.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Treaty <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6928737.stm" target="_blank">surrendered 70 vetoes over EU law</a>. Despite this, Brown <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/election/article-1266029/General-election-2010-Brown-claims-need-Lisbon-Treaty-referendum.html" target="_blank">claimed</a> that the Treaty had not led to &#8216;major constitutional changes&#8217;.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Lisbon Treaty included the <strong>dangerous</strong> Charter of Fundamental Rights, although the Government falsely claimed at the time it had an &#8216;opt out&#8217;. This has been used to strike down the UK&#8217;s surveillance regime. In July 2015, the Divisional Court in London annulled the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act 2014, for being inconsistent with the <a href="https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/davis_judgment.pdf" target="_blank">Charter of Fundamental Rights</a>. The Home Secretary, <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm140715/debtext/140715-0002.htm#14071547000001" target="_blank">Theresa May</a>, had said the legislation was &#8216;crucial to fighting crime, protecting children, and combating terrorism&#8217;. The European Court will now decide whether the legislation is allowed <strong>after the referendum</strong>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Gordon Brown was Chancellor when Tony Blair <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo050608/debtext/50608-03.htm#50608-03_spmin2" target="_blank">surrendered half of the UK rebate</a>, despite the Government promising that &#8216;the rebate will remain and we will not negotiate it away. Period&#8217;. Tony Blair&#8217;s changes have now cost the UK at least <a href="http://forbritain.org/140518_eu_rebate_blair.pdf" target="_blank">£10.4 billion</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Gordon Brown is <strong>wrong</strong> to claim the EU is needed to crack down on tax avoidance. The European Court has forced us to make multi-billion tax refunds to multinationals.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Judgements of the European Court in favour of big businesses have led to <a href="http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/uk_news/National/article1686411.ece" target="_blank">massive liabilities for the taxpayer</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The <a href="http://cdn.budgetresponsibility.org.uk/March2016EFO.pdf#page=136" target="_blank">OBR</a> now forecasts that HMRC will pay out <strong>£7.3 billion</strong> from 2016-2017 to 2020-2021, an average of <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/families/datasets/familiesandhouseholdsfamiliesandhouseholds/current/familieshouseholdsv2_tcm77-422171.xls" target="_blank">£270.43</a> per household.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The UK has<a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=62012CJ0362&amp;lang1=en&amp;type=TXT&amp;ancre=" target="_blank"> tried to block these payouts</a> before but its tax legislation has been overruled by the <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=62013CJ0640&amp;lang1=en&amp;type=TXT&amp;ancre=" target="_blank">European Court</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Justice Secretary, Michael Gove, has <a href="http://www.voteleavetakecontrol.org/after_we_vote_leave_we_will_act_quickly_to_protect_national_security_and_save_money" target="_blank">proposed emergency legislation immediately after the referendum to end these payouts</a>, stating: &#8216;The European Court has consistently come down in favour of big businesses not the British people &#8211; costing us billions. Very soon after a leave vote we will be able to legislate to ensure that EU judges are not able to meddle in our tax affairs again which will save British taxpayers from tens of billions of pounds worth of liabilities. I think we would all prefer it if that money is spent on schools and hospitals rather than filling the coffers of multinational corporations&#8217;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Gordon Brown has repeatedly talked Britain down. We should not listen to him.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Last year, Gordon Brown <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/mar/09/leaving-eu-would-make-uk-the-north-korea-of-europe-warns-gordon-brown" target="_blank">claimed</a> that those advocating a leave vote were supporting &#8216;the North Korea option, out in the cold with few friends, no influence, little new trade and even less new investment&#8217;.</p>
<p dir="ltr">During the 2010 general election campaign, Gordon Brown called lifelong Labour voter Gillian Duffy &#8216;bigoted&#8217; for <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/apr/29/gordon-brown-gillian-duffy-bigot" target="_blank">raising concerns about the level of immigration from Eastern Europe</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Gordon Brown did support the UK joining the single currency.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">In 1997, when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, said &#8216;British membership of a successful single currency would be <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199798/cmhansrd/vo971027/debtext/71027-06.htm#71027-06_head1" target="_blank">beneficial to Britain and Europe</a>&#8216;.</p>
<p dir="ltr">An official <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060214023906/http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/media//A8A24/single.pdf#page=7" target="_blank">Treasury assessment</a> published on the same day stated that the single currency would benefit the British economy: &#8216;Britain could make further gains in terms of stability from joining the single currency&#8230; The single currency could deepen competition in some parts of the Single Market. It will reduce transaction costs and exchange rate uncertainty on trade within the euro-zone. It will also make prices more transparent and easier to compare across the Single Market. It should also intensify competition. In this way it could open up new trading opportunities and encourage firms to invest in new markets&#8230;. British firms would be better placed to make the most of the opportunities if we were members of the single currency.&#8217;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Gordon Brown sold off Britain&#8217;s gold reserves at the bottom of the market</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Between 1999 and 2002, Mr Brown ordered the sale of almost 400 tons of the gold reserves when the price was at a 20-year low. The decision to sell the gold – taken by Mr Brown when he was Chancellor – is regarded as one of the Treasury&#8217;s worst financial mistakes and has <strong>cost taxpayers almost £16 billion</strong>.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Responding to claims from Charles Clarke, Lord Carlile of Berriew, and Peter Neyroud that the EU makes us safe, <strong>Foreign Office Minister James Duddridge said:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;It is completely disingenuous to suggest that we are safer inside the EU.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;EU law is undermining our bilateral relationships with key allies in the Five Eyes Alliance, whilst the European Court is seeking greater controls over our intelligence and security services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;The inability to control our own borders means that we cannot stop criminals entering the UK. And plans to give Turkey visa-free access to the EU will create a free travel zone from the English Channel to the borders of Syria and Iraq.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;In order to strengthen our national security, we must take back control on 23 June.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/CharlesClarke-e1462960986966.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-18724"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-18724" src="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/CharlesClarke-1024x683.jpg" alt="CharlesClarke" width="640" height="427" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>The British public will take no lectures from Charles Clarke on security, who was forced from office due to his inability to protect the public from foreign national offenders.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">In 2006, Charles Clarke was <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4975938.stm" target="_blank">sacked</a> as Home Secretary. This followed the Home Office&#8217;s decision to release <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4945922.stm" target="_blank">1,023 foreign national offenders</a> from prison without being considered for deportation. Those released into the community included <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1517344/Clarke-loses-half-of-most-dangerous-criminals.html" target="_blank">killers, rapists and child abusers</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Charles Clarke knows how dangerous it is for the European Court to be in control of our borders. As Home Secretary, he tried to exclude suspected terrorists the courts have concluded must remain in the UK because of EU law.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">In 2005, the Home Secretary, Charles Clarke, refused the French-Algerian national &#8216;ZZ&#8217; readmission on return from a trip to Algeria and expelled him on the grounds of public security.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=62011CJ0300&amp;lang1=en&amp;type=TXT&amp;ancre=" target="_blank">European Court of Justice</a> ruled that where the Home Secretary believes a suspected terrorist should be excluded from the UK, but also considers disclosing the case to the suspect would damage national security: &#8216;the person concerned must be informed, in any event, of the essence of the grounds on which a decision&#8217; against him is taken.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2014/7.html" target="_blank">Court of Appeal</a> observed that these rights under EU law &#8216;cannot yield to the demands of national security&#8217;. This means the Home Secretary either has to disclose information that might prejudice national security or allow suspected terrorists into the UK.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In 2015, the <a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/SIAC/2015/SC_63_2007.pdf" target="_blank">Special Immigration Appeals Tribunal</a> ruled the UK could not exclude ZZ from the UK because of EU law, despite the fact that he was a suspected terrorist. The Tribunal concluding that: &#8216;We are confident that the Appellant was actively involved in the GIA [Algerian Armed Islamic Group], and was so involved well into 1996. He had broad contacts with GIA extremists in Europe. His accounts as to his trips to Europe are untrue. We conclude that his trips to the Continent were as a GIA activist&#8217;.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Lord Carlile of Berriew knows how dangerous it is for the European Court to be in control of our intelligence agencies. He has supported surveillance legislation which has since been struck down because of the EU&#8217;s Charter of Fundamental Rights.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Lord Carlile supported the <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201415/ldhansrd/text/140716-0001.htm#14071671000141" target="_blank">Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Bill</a> in 2014, stating: &#8216;I support the Second Reading of the Bill on the understanding that its purpose is to preserve evidence of a kind that is currently available to the courts &#8230; There is a necessity to ensure that such crucial evidence remains available&#8217;.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Home Secretary, <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm140715/debtext/140715-0002.htm#14071547000001" target="_blank">Theresa May</a>, described the legislation as &#8216;crucial to fighting crime, protecting children, and combating terrorism&#8217;.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In July 2015, the <a href="https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/davis_judgment.pdf" target="_blank">Divisional Court</a> in London annulled the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act 2014 for being inconsistent with the EU&#8217;s Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In November 2015, the <a href="https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/davis_final.pdf" target="_blank">Court of Appeal</a> referred the legislation  to the European Court to see whether or not it is allowed. Lord Justice Lloyd Jones made clear that the European Court&#8217;s decisions &#8216;will remain central to the validity of all future legislation enacted by the Member States in this field&#8217;.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/11/european-court-to-consider-legality-of-uk-surveillance-laws" target="_blank">European Court</a> heard the case on 12 April, but it will not issue a decision until after the referendum on 23 June. The Justice Secretary, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/06/michael-gove-says-david-cameron-will-be-forced-to-take-immediate/" target="_blank">Michael Gove</a>, has proposed emergency legislation in the event of a leave vote to prevent the European Court interfering with our security services.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/eu-migrants-e1462442738204.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-18587"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18587" src="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/eu-migrants-e1462442738204.jpg" alt="eu-migrants" width="640" height="390" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>We have given up control of our borders to the European Court. This means we can&#8217;t ensure migrants have proper documents to come to the UK. The only way to take back control of our borders is to Vote Leave.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The UK&#8217;s border controls are under constant attack from the European Court of Justice. In December <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1457714881228&amp;uri=CELEX:62013CJ0202" target="_blank">2014</a>, the European Court said that the UK cannot require family members of EU citizens from other EU member states to have a permit issued by UK authorities. This is despite the fact that a High Court Judge had found permits from other EU countries to be <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2012/3368.html" target="_blank">systematically forged</a>, stating &#8216;Systemic abuse of rights and fraud calls for systemic measures&#8217;. <strong>The European Court&#8217;s rulings make it easier for terrorists and criminals to enter the UK using forged documents.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=62013CJ0202&amp;lang1=en&amp;type=TXT&amp;ancre=" target="_blank">2014 judgement of the European Court</a> also means that the UK cannot require persons purporting to be EU citizens to have a document issued by the British Government which attests to that status &#8216;in pursuit of an objective of general prevention&#8217; of terrorism and serious crime.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This constitutes a threat to the UK&#8217;s security, in light of the fact that &#8216;eight Schengen countries were on the list of the top 10 nations reporting stolen or lost passports in Interpol&#8217;s databases&#8217;, according to the former <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/19/opinion/europes-welcome-sign-to-terrorists.html?smid=tw-nytopinion&amp;smtyp=cur" target="_blank">Secretary General of Interpol, Ronald K Noble</a>. This is a risk to security. The Italian ID card, for example, is made of laminated card. In April 2016, Frontex noted that: &#8216;The number of persons aiming to get to the UK with fraudulent document significantly increased (+70%) compared to 2014. This trend is mostly attributable to the increasing number of Albanian nationals often misusing Italian and Greek ID cards followed by Ukrainian nationals <a href="http://frontex.europa.eu/assets/Publications/Risk_Analysis/Annula_Risk_Analysis_2016.pdf#page=27" target="_blank">abusing authentic Polish ID cards</a>&#8216;.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The UK is <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:02004L0038-20110616" target="_blank">obliged</a> to admit EU citizens with ID cards as well as passports.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The European Court has also held that the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A62003CJ0503" target="_blank">UK cannot automatically refuse persons entry because of an alert on the Schengen Information System</a>, &#8216;without having first verified whether their presence constituted a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the fundamental interests of society&#8217;.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ECthR-e1462960639746.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-18722"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18722" src="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ECthR-e1462960639746.jpg" alt="euchr" width="640" height="426" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>The European Court has made it much harder to remove terrorist sympathisers and convicted killers.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">On 4 February 2016, <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=62014CC0165&amp;lang1=en&amp;type=TXT&amp;ancre=" target="_blank">Advocate General Professor Maciej Szpunar</a> issued an opinion stating that it was &#8216;in principle&#8217; contrary to the Treaties to remove &#8216;CS&#8217; from the UK, notwithstanding the fact that she had been convicted and sentenced to a year&#8217;s imprisonment. It was subsequently revealed under parliamentary privilege that &#8216;CS&#8217; was the daughter-in-law of Abu Hamza, who was convicted of attempting to smuggle a SIM card to him in high security prison (Guardian, 6 February 2016,<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/06/woman-fighting-deportation-is-abu-hamzas-daughter-in-law-says-mp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> link</a>).</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.bailii.org/nie/cases/NICC/2011/5.html" target="_blank">EU law</a> prevents us from removing serious criminals, such as violent killer Theresa Rafacz, a Polish national who killed her husband, including by kicking him in the face with a shod foot while he lay on the ground defenceless and drunk. Mr Justice Hart ruled the offence involved &#8216;gratuitous violence&#8217;. She was sentenced to four years&#8217; imprisonment. Nonetheless, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/9974183/EU-rules-allow-foreign-killer-to-stay-in-Britain.html" target="_blank">Mr Justice Blake</a> later ruled that EU law prevented her removal, stating that there was &#8216;no basis&#8217; which could &#8216;justify her deportation on the grounds of public policy&#8217;.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/May.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-18723"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18723" src="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/May.jpg" alt="May" width="620" height="469" srcset="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/May-300x227.jpg 300w, http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/May-600x454.jpg 600w, http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/May.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>In 2014, the Home Secretary said that ending the European Court&#8217;s control of our criminal justice system, which the Government accepts is the risky option, would form part of the renegotiation. It didn&#8217;t and the European Court remains in charge of many areas such as extradition and child protection.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">In November <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm141110/debtext/141110-0002.htm#141110-%200002.htm_spnew178" target="_blank">2014</a>, the Home Secretary, Theresa May, called for the jurisdiction of the European Court over justice and home affairs to be renegotiated, saying: &#8216;I am certainly no enthusiast for the European Court of Justice&#8230; I understand the concerns raised about the European Court of Justice in the many debates we have had on protocol 36. I believe we must look again at this matter in our renegotiations with the European Union before the referendum that a Conservative Government will deliver by the end of 2017&#8217;.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In November 2015, the Home Office <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/480129/prum_business_and_implementation_case.pdf#page=52" target="_blank">admitted</a> that: &#8216;The current Government would not have ceded CJEU jurisdiction over the field of policing and criminal justice during negotiation of the Lisbon Treaty. It is clear that accepting CJEU jurisdiction over measures in the field of policing and criminal justice is not risk free. This is because the CJEU can rule in unexpected and unhelpful ways&#8230; The Government considers, however, the risk of CJEU jurisdiction to be at its greatest as concerns matters relating to substantive criminal law. This is a matter that should be determined by our sovereign Parliament, particularly given that the relevant measures are often open to wide interpretation. This also reduces the risk of the EU obtaining exclusive external competence in relation to such matters&#8217;.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The European Court&#8217;s jurisdiction over justice and home affairs was unaltered by the renegotiation. As a result, it has jurisdiction over many sensitive areas, including <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1448872315934&amp;uri=CELEX:02002F0584-20090328" target="_blank">extradition</a>, <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32011L0093" target="_blank">child protection</a> and <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1421925131614&amp;uri=CELEX:32012L0029" target="_blank">victims&#8217; rights</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/2-e1462442146725.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-18585"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18585" src="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/2-e1462442146725.jpg" alt="Schengen mass migration" width="640" height="427" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>In January 2015, the Government called for greater action on the sharing of criminal records. Nothing has been done since. The EU institutions are too sclerotic to protect our security.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">In <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/home-secretary-urges-eu-counterparts-to-move-more-quickly-on-sharing-criminal-records" target="_blank">January 2015</a>, the Home Secretary, Theresa May, said: &#8216;We must work to share more data about criminal convictions, and must accelerate work to consider how we share conviction data proactively. We are making some progress through the SOMEC project on mobile criminals, but there is more to do. We need to ensure that all member states retain and share information about &#8220;spent&#8221; convictions for serious offences for appropriate lengths of time&#8217;.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Nothing has been done to adopt these proposals since.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The failure to share criminal records facilitates the <a href="http://www.voteleavetakecontrol.org/revealed_free_movement_of_criminals_is_a_risk_to_our_security" target="_blank">movement of dangerous criminals across the EU</a>. Those who have come to the UK include Victor Akulic, a Lithuanian with many convictions including for child rape, who within a year of entering the UK committed rape, with Lady Justice Hallett asking, &#8216;do we have to take in anybody, even if they have a conviction for raping a child?&#8217;, and Ireneusz Bartnowski, a Polish national with previous convictions who killed Guiseppe and Caterina Massaro within weeks of arriving in the UK in an attack the judge described as &#8216;evil beyond belief&#8217;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>It is not necessary to be in the EU to have working extradition arrangements.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">This deliberately conflates EU membership with the ability to have working extradition agreements. We have extradition agreements with many countries around the world, including the United States, without accepting the supremacy of EU law.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Recently, we extradited a <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/12091651/Arthur-Simpson-Kent-arrested-while-eating-a-coconut-on-Ghanaian-beach.html" target="_blank">murder suspect from Ghana</a> in just over a month. The suspect subsequently <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-36168402" target="_blank">pleaded guilty to murder</a> at the Central Criminal Court.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The UK could continue to be part of the European Arrest Warrant if we Vote Leave.  As the Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation, David Anderson QC, has confirmed, police and security cooperation would continue if we Vote Leave.  Asked: &#8216;But we could still have tools like the European Arrest Warrant and sharing of databases even if the UK left the EU?&#8217;, David Anderson replied: &#8216;I think that&#8217;s very likely&#8217; (BBC Daily Politics, 1 March 2016).</p>
<p dir="ltr">If we end the supremacy of EU law, we could also stop the European Arrest Warrant being abused by foreign prosecutors which is currently illegal under the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A62011CJ0399" target="_blank">EU&#8217;s Charter of Fundamental Rights</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/GCHQ-e1462962186242.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-18729"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-18729" src="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/GCHQ-1024x614.jpg" alt="GCHQ" width="640" height="384" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Leaving the EU will not affect intelligence sharing.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Most intelligence sharing is bilateral. It will not be affected if we Vote Leave. The crucial intelligence sharing agreement the UK has is the Five Eyes Agreement with Australia, Canada, New Zealand and America, but this is under threat from the European Court (see above). The respected former <a href="http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/opinions/brexit-would-not-damage-uk-security" target="_blank">Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service, Sir Richard Dearlove</a>, has said: &#8216;The crucial practical business of counter-terrorism and counter-espionage is conducted, even in Europe, through bilateral and very occasionally trilateral relationships. Brussels has little or nothing to do with them&#8230; if Brexit happened, the UK would almost certainly show the magnanimity not to make its European partners pay the cost&#8217;.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Leading counter-terrorism experts have made clear that <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/eureferendum/12175207/Being-in-the-EU-doesnt-keep-us-safe-from-terrorists.html" target="_blank">Europol</a> is irrelevant to counter-terrorism. Richard Walton,  head of Counter Terrorism Command at New Scotland Yard from 2011-15: &#8216;Europol, while a useful discussion forum, is largely irrelevant to day-to-day operations within the counter-terrorism sphere&#8217;.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Theresa May argued that they were &#8216;countries with <strong>poor populations and serious problems with organised crime, corruption, and sometimes even terrorism</strong>. We have to ask ourselves, is it really right that the EU should just continue to expand, conferring upon all new member states all the rights of membership?&#8217;</p>
<p><strong>Vote Leave&#8217;s Iain Duncan Smith agreed with the Home Secretary:</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;The Home Secretary is right to warn of the dangers of countries like Albania and Turkey being allowed to join the European Union. If these countries are let into the EU&#8217;s open border system it will only increase the pressure on our NHS, schools and housing. It will also vastly increase the risk of crime and terrorism on British streets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;After the Home Secretary&#8217;s powerful intervention, is the Prime Minister now going to make clear that the UK no longer supports their bid to join the EU? If he does not, will he make clear why he disagrees with his own Home Secretary?&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9La0WGBgwiA" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Following the Home Secretary&#8217;s comments today there are key questions the Prime Minister must answer.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Will the Prime Minister commit today to veto EU expansion to Albania, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey<i> under all circumstances?</i></li>
<li>Does the Prime Minister accept the Home Secretary&#8217;s comment that it is a bad idea to welcome countries that have &#8216;serious problems with organised crime, corruption, and sometimes even terrorism&#8217;?</li>
<li>Does the Government accept that giving 88 million persons the right to enter the UK will place a major burden on the NHS?</li>
<li>Does the forecast of an extra 3 million net migrants by 2030 take into account future EU accessions?</li>
</ol>
<p>Michael Gove MP added a few words after the Home Secretary&#8217;s admission:</p>
<p>&#8220;The EU response to the migration crisis is a Five Nations free-for-all with an invitation to Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, Albania and Turkey to join the Union. <strong>Because we cannot control our borders &#8211; and because our deal sadly does nothing to change this fact</strong> &#8211; public services like the <strong>NHS will face an unquantifiable strain as millions more become EU citizens and have the right to move to the UK.</strong> We cannot guarantee the same access people currently enjoy to healthcare and housing if these trends continue.<strong> There is a direct and serious threat to our public services, standard of living and ability to maintain social solidarity if we accept continued membership of the EU.</strong>&#8220;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Leader of the House of Commons Chris Grayling </b>today commented on the junior doctors&#8217; strike that will cause chaos in hospitals across the country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Getting to a proper seven day NHS could make a real difference to this country. It would be so much easier to pay for that change if we <strong>took back control of our £350 million a week contribution to the EU</strong> and spent it on our priorities. For example, the money at the heart of the current doctors dispute is just <strong>5%</strong> of our overall annual contribution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;<strong>We shouldn&#8217;t be spending billions on the EU</strong> that could make our <strong>NHS better</strong> and help deal with its current challenges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The <strong>Remain campaign</strong> also need to explain how they would provide enough money and doctors to cope with the <strong>3 million migrants they want to see come to Britain</strong> in the next fifteen years if we stay in the EU.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The NHS is already running to keep up with the demands placed on it by the <strong>huge influx of people into the country and by the ageing population.</strong>&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/nhs.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-18428"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18428" src="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/nhs.jpg" alt="nhs corridor" width="620" height="349" srcset="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/nhs-300x169.jpg 300w, http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/nhs-600x338.jpg 600w, http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/nhs.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Adding to the voice of reason was Vote Leave Chair Gisela Stuart MP, who said:</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;On Jeremy Hunt&#8217;s watch the <strong>NHS has plummeted into financial crisis</strong>. This Government is <strong>hurting patients by starving the NHS of the funding that it needs</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;A <strong>small fraction</strong> of the money that the <strong>EU takes from us each year</strong> could be used to give junior doctors the pay settlement they are looking for and <strong>end these damaging strikes</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;If we <strong>Vote Leave and invest more in the NHS</strong> then we could <strong>end the current health crisis, nurse the NHS back to health and improve care for patients</strong>. We should spend our money on our priorities like the <strong>NHS</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/o-NHS-facebook-e1461584484393.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-18426"><img class="size-large wp-image-18426 aligncenter" src="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/o-NHS-facebook-1024x681.jpg" alt="NHS" width="640" height="426" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We send <strong>£350m to the EU each week</strong> &#8211; amounting to <strong>£19.1bn each year</strong>. This means that if we <strong>Vote Leave</strong>, we can afford to reintroduce automatic annual increases, as the increased cost amounts to only 5.1% of the annual EU contribution (the equivalent of just two and a half weeks&#8217; worth of EU contribution).</p>
<p><strong>Save our NHS by Voting Leave on June 23, you owe it yourself and your family&#8217;s health.</strong></p>

<p>With Obama back in America licking his wounds after being savaged for his heavily scripted meddling speeches, and the EU being inundated with even more migrants crossing into the continent from Libya and Greece, the augurs do not bode well.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MIGRANTS-e1454796870825.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-17187"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-17187" src="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MIGRANTS-1024x683.jpg" alt="MIGRANTS" width="640" height="427" /></a></p>
<p>Speaking today on the Andrew Marr show, the Home Secretary admitted that &#8216;<strong>free movement makes it harder to control immigration&#8217;</strong> and <strong>&#8216;I understand why people are concerned about immigration. It has an effect on public services and jobs&#8217;.</strong></p>
<p>Theresa May&#8217;s speech at the <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/theresa-may-s-speech-to-the-conservative-party-conference-in-full-a6681901.html" target="_blank">2015 Conservative conference</a> further reinforced the trepidation over mass unfettered immigration into the UK: &#8220;Even if we could manage all the consequences of mass immigration, Britain does not need net migration in the hundreds of thousands every year &#8230; The evidence – from the OECD, the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee and many academics – shows that while there are benefits of selective and controlled immigration, at best the net economic and fiscal effect of high immigration is close to zero. So there is <strong>no case, in the national interest, for immigration of the scale we have experienced over the last decade</strong>. Neither is it true that, in the modern world, immigration is no longer possible to control &#8230; <strong>The numbers coming from Europe are unsustainable and the rules have to change</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p>In 2015 the <a href="http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/world_news/article1600014.ece" target="_blank">Home Secretary</a> said that EU migrants should have to have a job offer to enter the UK, but David Cameron&#8217;s supposed renegotiation omitted this stipulation and <a href="http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-1-2016-INIT/en/pdf#page=22" target="_blank">all EU migrants</a> who come to the UK can just say they are &#8216;looking for work&#8217;. Under EU law <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A61989CJ0292" target="_blank">ECR I-745</a>  it is illegal to refuse entry to anyone within the EU borders.</p>
<p>Thousands of people are pouring into the EU borders daily. The primary routes are through Greece and Italy, however there are new routes opening up from Russia and the Black Sea. Once in the EU, they have the right to make their way into the UK when they become registered by the authorities within the European Union.</p>
<p>Not only is the EU making it harder to deport dangerous criminals from the UK, but the head of <a href="http://news.sky.com/story/1645171/warning-of-up-to-5000-jihadists-in-europe" target="_blank">Europol</a> even admitted, Jihadists and dangerous terrorists are flowing into the continent and into the UK.</p>
<p>More than a quarter of a million people came to the UK from the EU over the last twelve months – a city the size of Newcastle – which adds to the pressures on our NHS and other public services.</p>
<p><strong>The only way to take back control of our borders and have a fair immigration policy is to Vote Leave on 23 June.</strong></p>

<p>As the <strong>fifth largest economy in the world</strong>, and a <strong>major export market for the USA</strong>, the United Kingdom is well placed to <strong>secure a swift deal</strong> too.</p>
<p>Commenting, <b>Chris Grayling MP </b>said<b>:</b></p>
<p>&#8220;This is a case of <strong>political positioning trumping reality</strong> and is a million miles away from from the <strong>facts</strong> on the ground. The United States reached deals with Canada and Australia in <strong>two years</strong> so no one will seriously believe it will take five times as long to conclude a UK deal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;<strong>No American President would consider giving up as much sovereignty as we have</strong>. This referendum is about us <strong>regaining our independence as a nation and taking back control of our economy, our borders and the £350 million we hand to Brussels each week.</strong>&#8221;</p>

The agreement came into effect on <a href="https://www.austrade.gov.au/Australian/Export/Free-Trade-Agreements/AUSFTA" target="_blank">1 January 2005</a>. The US Government states that: &#8216;as a result of the U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement, tariffs that averaged <a href="http://export.gov/fta/australia/" target="_blank">4.3 percent</a> were eliminated on more than 99% of the tariff lines for U.S. manufactured goods exports to Australia&#8217;.</li>
<li><b><i>The US-Canada free trade agreement was negotiated in less than two years.</i></b> According to the Government of Canada, &#8216;In 1987, both countries agreed to the <a href="http://www.international.gc.ca/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/us-eu.aspx?lang=eng" target="_blank">Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement</a> (CUSFTA). Negotiations toward a free trade agreement with the U.S. began in 1986. The two nations agreed to a historic agreement that placed Canada and the United States at the forefront of trade liberalization. Key elements of the agreement included the elimination of tariffs, the reduction of many non-tariff barriers, and it was among the first trade agreements to address trade in services. It also included a dispute settlement mechanism for the fair and expeditious resolution of trade disputes&#8217;.</li>

<li><b><i>The US currently has <a href="https://ustr.gov/trade-agreements/free-trade-agreements" target="_blank">20 free trade agreements in force</a>, including with countries such as Bahrain, Costa Rica and El Salvador</i></b>.

<p>&#8220;I had a great trip. As soon as I landed, some guy came up to me and said &#8216;Back of the queue!&#8217; I said what? In the U.S. we say &#8216;line&#8217; we don&#8217;t say &#8216;queue&#8217;. Then another guy came up to me, he said he was the PM or something. He gave me a piece of paper and told me to say those words to the BBC.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, ain&#8217;t that Prince George cute? I bowed down to him, and said &#8216;Massa what can I do you for?&#8217; he just looked at me and rode off on his little horsie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Michelle and I got a ride from Prince Philip, you know the guy with the Tourettes. He kept telling me to mind my own business, and to take my TTIP and wipe my ass with it. I said &#8216;do you mean TP?&#8217; He said no, the TTIP that you&#8217;re peddling and will kill the British welfare system designed to keep the oiks happy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those guys at the BBC were great to me, they gave me my own talk, and I immediately phoned Brussels to tell them to up the funding.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, and I played golf with that Lord Haw Haw guy, whatsisname? He said I did good and I read the script fine. Only thing is I didn&#8217;t fool anyone, so now I must leave before I do&#8217;s more damage. I <em>aksed</em> him, what I did wrong? He said that the whole thing has now backfired and more people are going to vote Brexit because they don&#8217;t like meddling Kenyans telling them what to do. Then I <em>aksed</em> him why a lame duck like me would possibly make any difference anyway? Cameron gave me the silent treatment after that.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyways, good to be back home. Plain sailing from now on till retirement. I&#8217;m just going to do what I did throughout my presidency. Play golf, take expensive taxpayer funded holidays, talk about gay rights and ignore everything else.&#8221;</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p><strong>Britain is already back of the queue in the EU</strong>, paying <strong>£19 Billion to Brussels every year</strong>. EU regulations cost British businesses <strong><a href="http://Obamo threats hve been debunked. https://t.co/UXbcEpF5M6… #Brexit #VoteLeave #euref #eureferendum #remain" target="_blank">£41 Billion every year</a></strong>. The costs outweigh the benefits of EU membership. Britain is the EU&#8217;s cash cow and needs to break free from this costly unprofitable exploitative EU money black hole.</p>
<p>Firstly, <strong>Obama is a lame duck president</strong>, and has <strong>no powers left</strong>. On June 24, if the country has voted to leave, nothing much would happen. There is no sudden cut-off period, and there will certainly not be any volcanoes erupting in Shropshire or Nuneaton as the scaremongering Remain campaigners are suggesting.</p>
<p><strong>Respected credit agency Moody&#8217;s</strong> acknowledged in a recent conclusive report that: <a href="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/business/17870-moodys-do-not-listen-to-scaremongering-brexit-will-leave-uk-safe-economically.html" target="_blank">&#8220;No tariffs or treaties would change on 24 June, in the event of a vote to leave</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>Secondly, Obama will not be president in November, he will be gone and will not be able to damage Britain further, so his intervention is misplaced scaremongering from a<strong> lame duck</strong> with no qualification to lecture the UK, or <strong>spread malicious scare stories to skew the EU referendum.</strong></p>
<p>Thirdly, the<i></i><b> UK has the highest growth in the G7.</b> The <a href="http://www.oecd.org/eco/outlook/OECD-February-2016-Interim-Economic-Outlook-Forecasts-data.xlsx" target="_blank">OECD</a> has forecast that the UK will be the fastest growing economy in the G7 in 2016, with growth of 2.1%. On Brexit, this would be an immense bargaining chip to open up further global deals across areas currently restricted by the EU. Voting Leave opens the door to a myriad of trading deals, that will be lucrative for Britain in the long term, and increase its economic status to much higher projected levels than ever before.</p>
<p>Not only does Obama not have the power any more to stick Britain in the back of the queue, but as an example the<b><i> <a href="http://www.iwar.org.uk/news-archive/crs/23195.pdf" target="_blank">US-Australia FTA</a> was concluded in less than two years</i></b>: Formal negotiations for a free trade agreement began in Canberra on 18 March 2003. The agreement came into effect on <a href="https://www.austrade.gov.au/Australian/Export/Free-Trade-Agreements/AUSFTA" target="_blank">1 January 2005</a>. The <a href="http://export.gov/fta/australia/" target="_blank">US Government</a> states that ‘as a result of the U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement, tariffs that averaged 4.3 percent were eliminated on more than 99% of the tariff lines for U.S. manufactured goods exports to Australia’. Therefore, Obama&#8217;s misplaced scaremongering comments are moot and false.</p>
<p>If the country Votes to Leave on June 23 not only will Britain<strong> take control over its laws, and retain its sovereignty, but our economy would grow solidly with newer better trade deals, we would also increase levels of employment</strong>. In a recent report for the CBI, PwC had to admit that <a href="http://news.cbi.org.uk/news/leaving-eu-would-cause-a-serious-shock-to-uk-economy-new-pwc-analysis/leaving-the-eu-implications-for-the-uk-economy/" target="_blank">employment will grow if we Vote Leave</a>. It also stated that <strong>‘our model estimates suggest that [t]otal real UK GDP could be around 36-39% higher in 2030 than in 2015 in the two exit scenarios</strong>’. The paper also admits that growth will continue in the short term and that, in the long term, <strong>economic growth will be <i>stronger </i>outside the EU compared to remaining inside.</strong></p>
<p>Do not listen to people putting Britain down, do not listen to the scaremongering threats.</p>
<p>We Will <strong>Vote Leave</strong> on<strong> June 23</strong> and there is <strong>NOTHING</strong> they can Do About It.</p>

<p>US Presidential visits traditionally do not occur close to elections and the British people are &#8216;puzzled&#8217; that Obama is urging the UK to remain in a &#8216;dysfunctional&#8217; EU, especially as the Eurozone is so close to &#8216;impending collapse&#8217;, Lord Owen says in his speech this evening.<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;When you are a member of a <strong>dysfunctional organisation like the EU</strong> that can <strong>neither reform nor restructure</strong> you have two choices: either to reluctantly remain in the organisation or be <strong>brave enough to leave</strong>.  That is the choice that faces individual British voters on <strong>23 June</strong>.</p>
<p>&#8220;There has been a long tradition that US Presidential visits to this country do not take place close to General Election periods. The reasons for this are obvious and hitherto scrupulously observed by Washington D.C. They also govern Prime Ministers visiting the United States.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the autumn of 1978 as Foreign Secretary I mused about possibly inviting President Carter to repeat his very successful 1977 visit to Britain before October 1979. In the event we had an election in May. But I was wisely reminded that there had been some criticism of the only precedent of a visit close to a likely election when President Eisenhower met with Harold Macmillan on a visit to Britain from 27 August &#8211; 2 September 1959 with an election being called for 8 October.  President Carter played these sort of issues by the book and so I quickly shelved the idea. <strong>There were correctly no Presidential visits by President Ford surrounding the 1975 referendum on coming out of the Common Market.</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;President Obama&#8217;s first Secretary of the Treasury has used some very tough language about the Eurozone in his book <i>Stress Test</i> published in 2014. He wrote, &#8216;<strong>The second drag on our recovery was Europe, which was in financial and economic disarray</strong>,&#8217; and &#8216;<strong>the European mess was a serious threat to us&#8230; The sudden panic in Europe was shocking&#8230; Now Europe was burning again, and it did not seem to have the tools or the desire to control the fire. The Eurozone was sixteen [now 19] nations with sixteen fiscal policies and sixteen banking systems</strong>&#8216;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Geithner writes in words with which I totally agree.  &#8216;For all the flaws of the U.S. system, our fragmented regulatory agencies were at least part of the same nation, with a common language and traditions. And we routinely transferred resources to economically weak regions through our national budget.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Six years later, despite constant urging by Geithner and Jack Lew, his successor as Secretary of the Treasury, the Eurozone remains basically unchanged, though now practising quantitative easing under ECB Chairman Draghi.</p>
<p>&#8216;No wonder many British people are puzzled, to say the least, why President Obama should, in the light of his and our failure to reform the Eurozone, come into the midst of our referendum campaign to urge us to remain in the EU, <strong>despite an impending collapse of the Eurozone</strong> which would <strong>impact far more on the UK than the US</strong>.</p>
<p>&#8220;The U.S. Defence Department for decades has been hostile to <strong>EU &#8216;common defence&#8217;</strong> and to <strong>&#8216;autonomous defence&#8217;</strong> in the EU as well as to having two planning centres for defence in Europe, one in the EU and one in NATO. That is no secret and a factual judgement which I and many other people in Britain share.</p>
<p>&#8220;President Obama in his recent interview for the <i>Atlantic</i> magazine, correctly, and in the view of many Europeans rightly, openly criticised us in Europe for &#8216;freeloading&#8217; on the NATO defence budget. It is clearly not tolerable for the U.S. voters that they should pay 73% or 75% of the NATO budget. That direction of travel has got to be corrected and soon.  <strong>But it will not be done by the EU.</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;While the <strong>EU is dysfunctional</strong> NATO is not. NATO would benefit today from a solely committed British voice not one hovering between it and EU defence. By the people&#8217;s choice, not its elite, Denmark is not part of some EU treaty language on defence. <strong>A core priority after Brexit must be for the UK to strengthen NATO and help improve the Alliance&#8217;s capability to act cooperatively to preserve peace and security including dealing with ISIL</strong>.</p>
<p>&#8220;President Obama is, I am sure, aware that his former Secretary of Defence, Robert Gates, records in his book <i>Duty</i>  that the then Secretary General of NATO, Anders Rasmussen &#8216;<strong>had shared with him his concern that Germany would not agree to any NATO action on Libya, mainly because it wanted the European Union to be in the lead</strong>.&#8217;  We also know from General David Richards, the then UK Chief of Defence Staff, that he &#8216;insisted in the National Security Council that any military operation in Libya had to be a NATO operation&#8217; and that President Sarkozy was advocating an essentially Anglo-French operation &#8216;but we could not have done it with the French alone.&#8217; As it turned out the handling of the aftermath in Libya was a failure which President Obama admits more openly than David Cameron. There are many lessons for EU and NATO to be learnt here. They also have implications for the UN. Russia and China, having abstained over Libya in the Security Council so the military intervention was legal, have been far less receptive to help over Syria in the Security Council apart from negotiations over sarin gas.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Europe we are sleepwalking in relation to security questions and the situation is not stable.  There is no shadow of doubt that all European NATO member states should now increase their defence budgets as agreed two years ago in their Newport meeting to 2 per cent of their GDP. Sadly, there is little chance that they all will, but at least the <strong>UK has committed itself to doing so</strong>. There should also in future be less talk about EU military defence in EU documents such as the EU–Ukraine Association Agreement, less talk about EU common defence, and a <strong>far greater European commitment to NATO</strong>, not just in words but in actions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Outside the EU, the UK has an unique opportunity to shield itself from a future collapse in the Eurozone by starting to negotiate global trading arrangements, improving our competitiveness and simultaneously demonstrating a greater commitment to NATO.&#8221;</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>President Obama is not an American, he is more Kenyan and has deep anti-British sentiment. This is why he has no qualms about having Britain throw its sovereignty and control away, much like he discarded Churchill&#8217;s bust from the White House as soon as he became president.</p>
<p>Not only is Barack Obama not really an American, but he does not hold American values with regards to its allies, and its greatest ally has always been Britain, but under his tenure, this has faltered and become moribund.</p>
<p>The first thing Barack did when he got into the White House as a token president, was to angrily ask for the bust of Churchill to be removed from its place. He despised it, and he despises the British as much as he despises democracy, and freedom.</p>
<p>Ever the staunch Marxist, and follower of Alinsky, the U.S. president has condemned his own adopted country to a severely fractured state, as well as the global mess he will leave behind when he finally leaves office and hopefully is never seen again.</p>
<p>A disgrace to the office of the United States presidency, and a disgrace to the global order. But what else can be expected of someone only trained as a community organiser, with no geopolitical sense?</p>

<p dir="ltr">Obama&#8217;s stark double standards will come to light as he is escorted around town, a mouthpiece for the disinformation peddling <strong>Project Fear</strong> headed by David Cameron and his left hand man, Lord Mandelson.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Why should the UK give up its sovereignty and control of its borders when the <strong>USA does not have free movement of persons with the EU, Mexico or Canada</strong> and has no intention of introducing such arrangements?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Furthermore, the USA is now considering <strong>imposing visas and extra security screening on EU members</strong> because of the dangers now presented from the <strong>EU&#8217;s security failures</strong>. President Obama, however, advocates that <strong>British citizens remain subject to these dangers</strong>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The US <strong>refuses</strong> to countenance any surrender of <strong>national sovereignty to international courts or organisations.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Iain Duncan Smith MP, who is part of the Vote Leave campaign, revealed his discontent at this hypocritical Obama intervention during the lead up to the EU referendum:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;I have a huge amount of respect for America&#8217;s unrelenting commitment to the patriotic principle of self-governance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;President Obama, and every one of his predecessors, have ferociously protected the <strong>sovereignty of the USA</strong> &#8211; and I only wish we could say the same of our leaders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;What I do find strange is that he is <strong>asking the British people to accept a situation that he patently would not recommend to the American population</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;I can imagine no circumstances under which he would lobby for the <strong>US Supreme Court to be bound by the judgements of a foreign court</strong>. Nor can I imagine any circumstances in which he would accept that <strong>laws should be made for­-  or taxes imposed on­ &#8211; the people of the United States without the approval of Congress</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;If he believes it would be unacceptable for the American people &#8211; those he is actually elected to guide &#8211; I fail to see how it is appropriate for him to recommend that the British people continue to <strong>relinquish their right to democratic self governance</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;<strong>It is wrong for the US, and equally I believe it to be wrong for the UK</strong>. That&#8217;s why I am campaigning for us to <strong>leave the European Union and take back control of our borders and our law</strong> making powers, as well as the <strong>£350m we send to the EU every single week</strong>, so we can spend it on our own priorities instead.&#8221;</p>

<p>Apart from being able to play twenty instruments, arrange, dance and compose some amazing songs, Prince was also a reclusive eccentric who was born into a time that made his music timeless.</p>
<p>From falsetto to baritone, this mutha had everything, and there will possibly be none like him ever again.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Tracy died soon after a long fought civil war,<br />
just after I&#8217;d wiped away his last tear<br />
I guess he&#8217;s better off than he was before,<br />
A whole lot better off than the fools he left here<br />
I used 2 cry 4 Tracy because he was my only friend<br />
Those kind of cars don&#8217;t pass u every day<br />
I used 2 cry 4 Tracy because I wanted to see him again,<br />
But sometimes sometimes life ain&#8217;t always the way&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Sometimes it snows in April<br />
Sometimes I feel so bad, so bad<br />
Sometimes I wish life was never ending,<br />
and all good things, they say, never last</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Springtime was always my favorite time of year,<br />
A time 4 lovers holding hands in the rain<br />
Now springtime only reminds me of Tracy&#8217;s tears<br />
Always cry 4 love, never cry 4 pain<br />
He used 2 say so strong unafraid to die<br />
Unafraid of the death that left me hypnotized<br />
No, staring at his picture I realized<br />
No one could cry the way my Tracy cried</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Sometimes it snows in April<br />
Sometimes I feel so bad<br />
Sometimes, sometimes I wish that life was never ending,<br />
And all good things, they say, never last</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I often dream of heaven and I know that Tracy&#8217;s there<br />
I know that he has found another friend<br />
Maybe he&#8217;s found the answer 2 all the April snow<br />
Maybe one day I&#8217;ll see my Tracy again</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Sometimes it snows in April<br />
Sometimes I feel so bad, so bad<br />
Sometimes I wish that life was never ending,<br />
But all good things, they say, never last</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">All good things that say, never last<br />
And love, it isn&#8217;t love until it&#8217;s past</p>

<p>The fact is that it is the EU itself that pushes up energy prices.</p>
<p>Here are the <strong>FACTS</strong> about how voting to Leave the EU would be beneficial for British energy:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Energy prices would not rise if we Vote Leave. EU regulation forces up energy prices.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The European Commission has admitted: &#8216;Energy costs [are] to rise in all scenarios&#8217; (European Commission, May 2013, <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/pdf/energy3_en.pdf#page=8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">link</a>). There is no evidence that the &#8216;single market&#8217; will reduce prices.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">End-user gas prices are now nearly twice as high in the UK than in the US (Business for Britain, June 2015, <a href="http://forbritain.org/cogchapter16.pdf#page=22" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">link</a>).</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Between 2005 and 2011, &#8216;EU manufacturing saw the highest increase in energy costs&#8217; relative to the US, China and Japan (European Commission, 2014, <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:52014SC0020" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">link</a>).</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">According to the former European Commission President Jose Barroso, between 2005 and 2012 the gas price for European industry increased by 35 per cent and the electricity price increased by 38 per cent. In the US, by contrast, gas prices fell by 66 per cent and electricity prices fell by 4 per cent (European Commission, May 2013, <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/pdf/energy3_en.pdf#page=3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">link</a>).</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">EU energy regulation will cost the UK economy between £86.6bn and £93.2bn (Business for Britain, June 2014, <a href="http://businessforbritain.org/BFBEnergyPaper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">link</a>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>The UK is not at risk from Putin&#8217;s Russia if we Vote Leave. The UK is one of the most energy self-sufficient countries in Europe.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The UK does not depend on the EU (or Russia) for energy imports: &#8216;The main direct source of UK gas imports is direct from Norway. In 2012 55% of the UK&#8217;s gas imports came via the pipelines to Norway or connections with the Norwegian gas fields&#8217; (House of Commons Library, August 2013, <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/sn04046.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">link</a>).</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The UK is one of the EU countries that is least dependent on Russian gas imports (European Council on Foreign Relations, March 2015, <a href="http://www.ecfr.eu/article/commentary_europes_vulnerability_on_russian_gas" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">link</a>).</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The UK is 49.5% sufficient in natural gas. Germany is 13.3% self-sufficient. France is 0.7% self-sufficient (International Atomic Energy Agency, 2013, <a href="http://www.iea.org/gtf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">link</a>).</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Other countries such as Germany, are dangerously dependent on Russian Gas. The Commission acknowledges, &#8216;Europe&#8217;s dependence is set to increase&#8217; (European Commission, 22 May 2013, <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/pdf/energy3_en.pdf#page=3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">link</a>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>National Grid admits that the impact of leaving would be &#8216;minimal&#8217; in the short-term. The UK could adapt.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The National Grid presentation states: &#8216;The risks for gas as a result of Brexit are minimal in the nearer term&#8217; and acknowledges that the &#8216;UK government could minimise risks of Brexit&#8217;. It notes that key aspects would be &#8216;cheap to mitigate&#8217;.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The National Grid clearly states that: &#8216;We are not advocating to leave or remain in the EU&#8217;.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The Government has admitted that &#8216;we don&#8217;t back legally-binding rules in this area&#8217; (Telegraph, 16 February 2016, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/energy/oilandgas/12160417/UK-business-gas-supplies-could-be-diverted-to-households-in-Europe-under-EU-crisis-plan.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">link</a>). Nonetheless, they will not be able to stop the proposals in the event of a vote to remain.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>The National Grid report inaccurately claims that the UK has &#8216;influence on EU rules &amp; policies to ensure they are advantageous to the UK.&#8217;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The UK has been outvoted every time it has voted against an EU measure &#8211; 72 times in total. 40 of these defeats have taken place since David Cameron became Prime Minister (Vote Leave, October 2015, <a href="https://gallery.mailchimp.com/1026e6b00f73284a7e46eb046/files/20151009_UK_influence.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">link</a>). We have no influence at present.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The UK&#8217;s ability to control whether or not to build a new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point has been restrained by the need to await approval from the Commission. The Commission&#8217;s decision in favour of the scheme is currently the subject of legal challenge in the European Court by Austria (Austria v Commission, Case T-365/15, <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1457460189705&amp;uri=CELEX:62015TN0356" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">link</a>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>The report claims that interconnectors are less likely if we Vote Leave. There is no evidence for this assertion.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Germany has just agreed to establish a new interconnector with Norway &#8211; which is not in the EU (European Commission, October 2014, <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_STATEMENT-14-313_en.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">link</a>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>National Grid spends hundreds of thousands lobbying the Commission.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">In 2014-2015, National Grid spent between €300,000 and €399,999 lobbying the Commission (European Commission, 23 March 2016, <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/transparencyregister/public/consultation/displaylobbyist.do?id=56039866688-26" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">link</a>).</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Between 2007 and 2014 National Grid and group companies received over €3.2m in grants from the European Commission (European Commission, 23 March 2016, <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/budget/fts/index_en.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">link</a>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>The real risk to UK energy security comes from EU membership. The Commission has just announced plans to force the UK to share gas with other member states. This could lead to gas rationing for business in the UK.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">In February 2016, the European Commission announced legislative proposals for mandatory sharing of gas between member states (European Commission, 16 February 2016, <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/news/commission-proposes-new-rules-gas-and-heating-and-cooling-strategy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">link</a>).</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The Commission envisages rationing of gas in the UK in the event of a shortage in other member states: &#8216;Application of the solidarity principle on the basis of technical and administrative arrangements agreed between Member States will be mandatory. Customers others than households, essential social services and district heating cannot continue to be supplied with gas in a given Member State &#8211; even if it is not in an emergency situation &#8211; as long as households, essential social services and district heating are not being supplied in another Member State in emergency to which the first country&#8217;s transmission network is connected&#8217; (European Commission, 16 February 2016, <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52016PC0052" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">link</a>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>The Conservative Party predicted the Commission would take control over energy when it opposed the Lisbon Treaty eight years ago. It is now campaigning for the EU to retain powers over energy.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">During the passage of the Lisbon Treaty, the Conservatives tabled amendments, signed by William Hague and David Lidington, trying to stop the EU gaining control of energy policy (House of Commons, 30 January 2008,<a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmbills/048/pro0483001p.131-133.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> link</a>).</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The then Shadow Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, Alan Duncan, warned that the Treaty&#8217; jeopardises our ability to act independently on energy matters&#8230; Our Government have essentially written a blank cheque to Brussels, which could in certain circumstances oblige the United Kingdom, for example, to assist in the building of other member states&#8217; energy infrastructure.&#8217; He also warned that the Treaty &#8216;mandates the Council to redistribute energy across the bloc during times of crisis. A gas dispute in Bavaria could ultimately lead to gas rationing in Birmingham. If there is an interruption in the supplies from the Gulf, the Commission can override our contracts. It can cut off our supplies from Milford Haven and send them to Ingolstadt, or divert our liquefied natural gas from the Isle of Grain to Novo Mesto&#8217; (HC Deb 30 January 2008, cols 341-347, <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080130/debtext/80130-0009.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">link</a>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Leaving the EU would not lead to a reduction in investment.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Notwithstanding the referendum, China recently announced £30 billion of investment into the UK, including between £5.4bn to £8.2bn in nuclear power (Telegraph, 21 October 2015, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/china-business/11943880/China-to-invest-30bn-in-UK-plc-how-the-deals-break-down.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">link</a>). This will continue if we Vote Leave.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Everyone loves a drink, including the DS staff, and it is to this end that we and many Britons are bemused by the Remain campaigners who are constantly putting Britain down.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The EU has made booze for Britons more expensive and not only that, restricted how our beverages companies can trade globally.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We should be selling our whisky to the world, instead the EU restricts British drinks companies from striking free trade deals with vitally important, lucrative markets.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If we <strong>Vote Leave</strong> and take back control then our drinks trade will prosper &#8211; something both drinkers and exporters can raise a glass to, and buying a round won&#8217;t mean you need to take out a second mortgage or sell the car.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>600,000 jobs in the UK alcohol industry are NOT at risk if we Vote Leave.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">These jobs depend on trade with countries in the EU, not on membership of the EU.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The Prime Minister has accepted that trade would go on if we Vote Leave: &#8216;If we were outside the EU altogether, we&#8217;d still be trading with all these European countries, of course we would&#8230; Of course the trading would go on. Sometimes &#8230; There&#8217;s a lot of scaremongering on all sides of this debate. Of course the trading would go on&#8217; (The Andrew Marr Show, 6 January 2013, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/060113.pdf#page=12" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">link</a>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>We import more beverages from the EU than we sell to them. They will want to strike a free trade agreement.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">In 2014, the UK exported £3.29 billion of beverages to the EU. The UK imported £5.26 billion of beverages from the EU (OECD, 2015, <a href="http://www.keepeek.com/Digital-Asset-Management/oecd/trade/united-kingdom_itcs-v2015-1-7-en#page14" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">link</a>;  HMRC, 2015, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/421061/average310315-1.csv/preview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">link</a>). The EU sold the UK £1.98 billion more in beverages than the UK sold the EU.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">This means they are sure to want to negotiate a new deal to preserve access to the world&#8217;s fifth largest market. French winemakers and German brewers will still want to sell the UK alcohol if we Vote Leave.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>The European Court has previously required the UK to increase the price of beer, putting jobs at risk.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">On 12 July 1981, the European Court ruled that the UK&#8217;s low duty on beer &#8216;afford[ed] protection to domestic beer production&#8217; and was therefore illegal under EU law (Commission v United Kingdom [1983] ECR 2265, <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A61978CJ0170%2801%29" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">link</a>). In his 1984 budget statement, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Nigel Lawson, said &#8216;we lost; and I am now implementing the judgment handed down by the court last year. Accordingly, I propose to increase the duty on beer by the minimum amount needed to comply with the judgment and maintain revenue: 2p on a typical pint of beer&#8217; (HC Deb 13 March 1984, col. 302, <a href="http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1984/mar/13/personal-taxation-taxes-on-spending#column_302" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">link</a>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Being in the EU means we cannot strike a trade deals with India, harming exports of alcohol.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">India charges an average tariff of 69.1% on beverages and tobacco, with the highest tariff of 150% on Scotch Whisky (IMF, 2016, <a href="https://www.wto.org/english/res_e/booksp_e/tariff_profiles15_e.pdf#page=92" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">link</a>).</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The EU has failed to strike a free trade deal with India.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The Chief Executive of the Scotch Whisky Association, David Frost, has said: &#8216;India is the biggest spirits market in the world and we have got 1 to 2 per cent of it. It is a difficult business environment. Everyone who does business there knows that (Scotsman, 7 December 2014, <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/business/companies/farming/little-chance-of-cut-to-india-whisky-tariff-1-3627498" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">link</a>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>The EU has been very bad at negotiating free trade deals compared to small countries.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The EU has concluded 37 trade agreements with 54 countries since 1970. In 2015, the aggregate GDP of all the countries with which the EU had a trade agreement in force was $7.7 trillion.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">By contrast, the aggregate GDP of all countries with which Chile had trade agreements was $58.3 trillion. The figure for South Korea was $40.8 trillion and that for Switzerland was $39.8 trillion (albeit these all include the EU with a GDP of $16.7 trillion) (Civitas, January 2016, <a href="http://www.civitas.org.uk/content/files/mythandparadox.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">link</a>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>The Head of the IN campaign has admitted trade deals with third countries could continue. There is no reason why any country would choose to deny itself access to the world&#8217;s fifth largest market.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The Executive Director of the IN campaign, Will Straw accepted that free trade agreements with third countries could continue after we Vote Leave, stating: &#8216;Either eventuality could come to pass, depending on what happened in that situation&#8217; (Evidence to Treasury Committee, 2 March 2016, <a href="http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/treasury-committee/the-economic-and-financial-costs-and-benefits-of-uks-eu-membership/oral/30171.pdf#page=22" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">link</a>).</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The UK is the world&#8217;s fifth largest economy (World Bank, 2015, <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?order=wbapi_data_value_2014+wbapi_data_value+wbapi_data_value-last&amp;sort=desc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">link</a>). There is no reason why any of the countries with which the EU has a free trade deal would choose to cut off their exporters&#8217; access to the world&#8217;s fifth largest market.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>It is possible to negotiate a trade agreement (FTA) very quickly outside the EU, certainly in less than two years.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The US-Australia FTA was concluded in less than two years. Formal negotiations for a free trade agreement began in Canberra on 18 March 2003 (Library of Congress, 3 August 2003, <a href="http://www.iwar.org.uk/news-archive/crs/23195.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">link</a>). The agreement came into effect on 1 January 2005 (Australian Government, 2016, <a href="https://www.austrade.gov.au/Australian/Export/Free-Trade-Agreements/AUSFTA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">link</a>). The US Government states that &#8216;as a result of the U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement, tariffs that averaged 4.3 percent were eliminated on more than 99% of the tariff lines for U.S. manufactured goods exports to Australia&#8217; (US Government, 2011, <a href="http://export.gov/fta/australia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">link</a>).</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Switzerland-China FTA was negotiated in just over two years. There were 9 rounds of negotiations between April 2011 and May 2013 which &#8216;produced a deal praised by both sides for its quality and its breadth, covering goods, services, investment, and competition (Centre for Security Studies, February 2014, <a href="http://www.css.ethz.ch/content/dam/ethz/special-interest/gess/cis/center-for-securities-studies/pdfs/CSSAnalyses147-EN.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">link</a>). The agreement entered into force on 1 July 2014 (Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs, 2016, <a href="http://www.seco.admin.ch/themen/00513/02655/02731/04118/index.html?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">link</a>).</p>

<p>The Schengen zone only works in a time of peace, but time and time again the EU has been warned of the repercussions of keeping the zone open when there is conflict close to its borders yet they have ignored the warnings.</p>
<p>The tragic bombings in Brussels today where countless people lost their lives and hundreds were injured, is a travesty of EU planning and engineering, as well as a condemnation of their lacklustre governance.</p>
<p>Until the EU shuts down the Schengen zone completely there will never be a respite to the terror meted out on the people, and all of this because of some utopian ideal that can only be accomplished in total peace time.</p>
<p><strong>Wake Up Europe</strong></p>
<p>We wrote an analysis of the situation in <a href="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/11468-think-tank-wake-europe-isis-closing.html" target="_blank">February 2015</a> warning of the Schengen zone, and how it must be shut down, but there was of course no action.</p>
<p>Jean Claude Juncker and Angela Merkel with their cohorts of faceless unelected eurocrats should hang their heads in shame today, for their policies and their turgid negligent governance has resulted in the death and injury of many.</p>
<p>Where does Britain lie in this shameful idiocy? We must Leave the EU immediately, as the European Union is not a safe place to be, either physically or economically.</p>
<p>Will the EU listen to these countless warnings? No! This is why Britain has to Get Out of the EU!</p>

<p>The incessant scaremongering of the British public by the Britain Stronger In campaign and its Project Fear has been found to be completely baseless and false by Moody&#8217;s, the credit agency.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Moody&#8217;s acknowledge that there would be no trade barriers or legal change the day after Britain votes to leave the EU. There would not be profound uncertainty, as even the head of the IN campaign has admitted.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Moody&#8217;s acknowledges in its report that &#8216;No tariffs or treaties would change on 24 June, in the event of a vote to leave&#8217;.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Moody&#8217;s points out that &#8216;We expect that, over time, the UK and EU would come to an arrangement to preserve most &#8230; of the current trading relationships, thereby limiting the impact on UK exporters and supply chains of UK importers.&#8217;</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The Chairman of the BSE campaign, Lord Rose of Monewden, has admitted: &#8216;Nothing is going to happen if we come out of Europe &#8230; There will be absolutely no change &#8230; It&#8217;s not going to be a step change or somebody&#8217;s going to turn the lights out and we&#8217;re all suddenly going to find that we can&#8217;t go to France, it&#8217;s going to be a gentle process&#8217; (The Times, 17 October 2015, <a href="http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/politics/article4588253.ece" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">link</a>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Moody&#8217;s make clear that the UK&#8217;s credit rating is not at threat.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">&#8216;We would expect few, if any, near-term rating changes in light of the timeline for a Brexit to take effect.&#8217;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Moody&#8217;s acknowledge that it is highly likely that the UK would strike a free trade agreement with the EU.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">&#8216;Given the substantial trade links that exist, there would be strong incentives for both the UK and EU to minimise the effect&#8217;.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">&#8216;Given the interlinkage of their economies, both the EU and the UK government would have a strong incentive to minimise the economic impact of a Brexit. We think that over time the UK would reach some new bilateral trade agreements with the EU&#8217;.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">&#8216;companies based in France or Germany that export to the UK could suffer if trade restrictions were put in place either by the UK or the EU; this is a key reason why we expect that negotiations would eventually lead to new agreement(s) to significantly mitigate the potential impact of Brexit&#8217;.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Moody&#8217;s acknowledge that talk of London ceasing to be a global financial centre is scaremongering.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">&#8216;we note that remaining outside the euro area did not significantly damage London&#8217;s status as a financial centre, and that factors other than a Brexit would also be key determinants for investment.&#8217;</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Moody&#8217;s also note that &#8216;HSBC&#8217;s decision to maintain its headquarters in London, even without knowing the outcome of the referendum, indicates that large banks appreciate the country&#8217;s regulatory framework and legal system and the large pool of highly skilled, international employees.&#8217;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Moody&#8217;s acknowledge the impact on key sectors would be limited.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Car manufacturers: &#8216; we would expect alternative trade agreements to be put in place&#8230; However, both the EU and the UK would have an incentive to retain the free flow of trade in the auto sector due to the overall volume of trade&#8230; The share of UK motor vehicle exports to EU countries by value has fallen over the past decade to 40% in 2014 from over 70% in 2000.&#8217;</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Aerospace: &#8216;the importance that the UK plays in the EU&#8217;s aerospace strategy and competitiveness would likely shield the sector from any major repercussions of a Brexit over time&#8217;.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Ports: &#8216;we believe that any negative impact would be mitigated as the UK either adopts alternative trade agreements with the EU or manages to diversify its trade to other regions&#8217;.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Oil &amp; gas: &#8216;the effect of a Brexit on the overall credit profiles of rated UK-based oil and gas companies&#8230; would be negligible as they are both global integrated oil and gas companies with substantial crude, natural gas and oil product trade flows outside the EU.&#8217;</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Energy companies: &#8216;final impact could be fairly mild&#8230; Rated UK electricity and gas networks generate virtually all their sales within the UK and the regulatory framework is almost entirely domestic.&#8217;</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Telecommunications: &#8216;In our view, the regulatory framework would be broadly similar, with the same objectives of stimulating investment and ensuring healthy competition.&#8217;</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Air travel: &#8216;given the significance of Heathrow airport, and the UK generally, for air travel within and outside the EU, it is highly likely that new agreements would, over time, be put in place, or that the UK would remain party to existing agreements, so as to sustain existing air traffic&#8230; we expect the overall impact of a Brexit would be low as the majority of travel would persist, in particular intercontinental travel.&#8217;</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Patents: &#8216;However, the EPO [European Patent Organisation] currently includes non-EU countries as members, such that the UK could also become a non-EU member.&#8217;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Not all of Moody&#8217;s claims are right: the notion that there will be weaker economic growth if we Vote Leave is not even borne out by the IN campaign&#8217;s economic analysis.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Moody&#8217;s claims that there would be &#8216;modestly weaker economic growth in the UK over the medium term&#8217;. This assumption is not borne out by the evidence.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">CBI analysis, conducted by PwC in March, found that economic growth will continue in the short term and that, in the medium term economic growth will be stronger outside the EU compared to remaining inside (Vote Leave, March 2016, <a href="http://www.voteleavetakecontrol.org/vote_leave_blasts_cbi_spin_as_report_reveals_that_both_the_economy_employment_will_grow_outside_of_the_eu?utm_campaign=160321_c_news&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=voteleave" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">link</a>).</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The same study also found that there would be an additional 3 million jobs if we Vote Leave.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Moody&#8217;s also state that a vote to leave the EU could lead to &#8216;a substantial disruption in&#8230; capital flows&#8217;.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Article 63 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (which was introduced by the Maastricht Treaty and has been in force since 1994) provides that &#8216;all restrictions on payments between Member States and third countries shall be prohibited&#8217; (European Commission, <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A12012E%2FTXT" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">link</a>).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The UK currently hands over £19 billion to the EU every year. We get £9 billion back in services and the rebate which means when we Vote Leave we will be able to guarantee all the funding to farmers, universities and regional grants that currently come from the EU and still have £10 billion more to spend on our priorities like the NHS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Conservatives for Britain spending suggestions for the first post-Brexit budget include:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><b>£1.1 billion</b> for disability benefits to avoid controversial cuts</li>
<li><b>£800 million </b>to train an extra <b>60,000 nurses</b> a year to deal with shortages and excess agency staff</li>
<li><b>£250 million </b>a year to provide an additional <b>10,000 doctors</b> a year to deal with doctor shortages and to staff the seven day NHS well</li>
<li><b>£750 million</b> a year on <b>social care</b> to offering better support for people in their own homes, and for more care home and respite care places.</li>
<li><b>£200 million</b> to <b>cancel hospital car parking charges </b></li>
<li><b>£400 million </b>for dearer medical treatments not currently licensed by NICE, for example cancer treatments such as Proton Beam therapy and Meningitis vaccines</li>
<li><b>£1.9 billion</b> to <b>abolish VAT</b> on domestic energy, energy saving materials, on converting existing dwellings and on carry cots, children&#8217;s car seats and safety seats</li>
<li><b>£1.5 billion</b> to <b>keep Council Tax down</b> by offering councils the money to pay for a discount on bills they issue</li>
<li><b>£900 million</b> to remove <b>Stamp Duty on the £125,000 to £250,000 band </b>of home purchase</li>
<li><b>£500 million </b>should be allocated to a <b>local road fund</b> to support local schemes to improve junction safety and flows, and to provide additional capacity and bypasses on busy roads in congested areas.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Commenting, John Redwood said:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8216;The UK currently hands over <strong>£19 billion</strong> to the EU every year. That&#8217;s <strong>£350 million</strong> a week. If we Vote Leave we will be able to spend our money on our priorities like the NHS. We would have an extra £10 billion to spend allowing us to recruit thousands of new nurses and doctors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8216;We would be able to provide the latest cancer treatments that the NHS currently can not afford and provide extra money for people who are frail and need long term care. We would no longer need to make controversial cuts to disability benefits and we could scrap the tampon tax and the EU&#8217;s VAT increases on green goods like solar panels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8216;Instead of sending billions abroad each year we should spend that money on improving our NHS and helping families by cutting unfair EU taxes. That&#8217;s why the safer choice in this referendum is to Vote Leave.&#8217;</p>

<p>Were we safer IN the EU on 7/7?</p>
<p>Were the unfortunate innocent commuters who were blown up mercilessly safer IN the EU?</p>
<p>No! No! No!</p>
<p>And if you vote to stay in the EU, it will get worse. We will see more attacks because of the open door Schengen policy.</p>
<p>Already, thousands of Jihadis have entered into the EU from Syria with little or no checks and it will get worse, a lot worse.</p>
<p>If you vote to remain in the EU, think about the victims on 7/7, think about the <a href="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/15740-experts-paris-friday-13th-schengen-massacre-a-tragedy-that-could-have-been-avoided.html" target="_blank">Paris terror victims at the Bataclan club</a>, were they safe IN the EU?</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>May it be on your head, because it only makes sense that Britain is safer OUT of the EU. We can make the necessary adjustments, we can deport dangerous criminals and terrorists, we can defend our borders from attack.</p>
<p>If you vote to remain in the EU, you will NOT be safer IN. Safety only comes from voting to get OUT of the EU.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because of the mass influx, and abuse of the system, if you need an ambulance, you will not get one. If you need immediate medical assistance you will not get it. If you need medicine to keep you alive, you will not get any,&#8221; an NHS official told the BBC.</p>
<p>The horror stories that flow out of the NHS even detail some instances of <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/nhs/12199883/NHS-spent-181000-treating-just-one-illegal-immigrant.html" target="_blank">£181,000</a> being spent on one single migrant.</p>
<p>There is little or no money left in the pot, and staying in the EU will increase the migration into the UK.</p>
<p>&#8220;The millions of migrants being accepted into the EU, only have to wait for a few years before they become EU citizens and are free to move within the open Schengen zone,&#8221; EU official Dietmer Schloss, told Euronews.</p>
<p>One concerned British citizen said: &#8220;Imagine if your child is sick. You call the ambulance. No one comes. What do you do? You voted to remain in the EU, and you will have to live with the consequences of your actions for the rest of your life &#8212; especially your child&#8217;s life, who is now lying dead in your arms.&#8221;</p>

Having resigned from a crumbling Cameron Cabinet full of filthy vipers, all is not lost however, there is much <em>Brexiting </em>to be done.</p>
<p><strong>The IDS of March</strong></p>
<p>Duncan Smith&#8217;s resignation was precipitated by the Chancellor, George Osborne foisting the unpopular disability cuts on the Work and Pensions minister. To be maligned in such a way, when IDS was profoundly against the unpopular cuts on the most vulnerable in society was a step too far, so he walked.</p>
<p>The Cameron government is now trying to backtrack on the cuts to disability, even going as far as to call them mere &#8216;budget proposals&#8217;. However, the damage has already been done.</p>
<p>Treachery and betrayal are part of politics, and the higher one gets, the stabbing gestures are ever more brutal.</p>
<p>Brothers in politics are not exempt either, one only has to look at the case history of the two Milibands to see how that one worked out.</p>
<p>When Hunter S. Thompson wrote about the benefits of the music industry, he could have well been discussing the halls of power in Westminster as well.</p>
<p>“The music business is a cruel and shallow money trench, a long plastic hallway where thieves and pimps run free, and good men die like dogs. There&#8217;s also a negative side.”</p>
<p>The workings of Osborne, to clear the path for his political dream, may one day backfire, for others will have no qualms about doing what he did to others &#8212; to him.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After economic and monetary accession talks were opened on 14 December 2015 as well as on <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/pdf/turkey/20160108-overview_negotiations_turkey.pdf" target="_blank">January 2016</a>, the latest round of talks today signal an immediate quickening of pace regarding Turkey&#8217;s EU interests.</p>
<p>The implications for Britain are very severe regarding the EU&#8217;s agenda to rein in Turkey, and has David Cameron&#8217;s <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/david-cameron/11283924/David-Cameron-I-still-want-Turkey-to-join-EU-despite-migrant-fears.html" target="_blank">full backing</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;..in terms of Turkish membership of the EU, I very much support that. That&#8217;s a long-standing position of British foreign policy which I support.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>75 million Turkish citizens will gain visa-free access to the Schengen zone</b></p>
<p>There are multiple threats regarding this action, the EU&#8217;s <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-euro-idUSKBN0TE1AU20151125" target="_blank">Schengen</a> open border system will facilitate a massive movement towards Britain, rendering the NHS, schools, and essential services, already overloaded to a standstill. Britain&#8217;s welfare system will have to be halted eventually as the amount of benefits recipients will outnumber those working; purely because there are not enough jobs to accommodate the influx of millions.</p>
<p>Visa liberalisation for Turkey will occur by the end of June 2016, just after the UK&#8217;s referendum.</p>
<p>Unless Britain votes to leave the bloated monstrosity of the EU, there will be open access from Syria&#8217;s border to the English Channel.</p>
<p>Foreign Secretary, Philip Hammond has stipulated that he is in favour of giving anyone who is within the Schengen zone <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3489582/Hammond-Let-s-create-Schengen-visa-open-borders-PM-ll-fire-anybody-leaks-that.html" target="_blank">full access</a> to the United Kingdom.</p>
<p><b>The UK is liable for an unlimited sum of money to Turkey to bail out the Schengen zone</b></p>
<p>Financed from the EU budget, which the UK pays into, it is therefore <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-statement/Commons/2016-03-07/HCWS582/" target="_blank">liable to pay</a> for Turkish refugee assistance and all other costs. This could extend to the multiples of billions.</p>
<p>The UK will thus <strong>not have a veto</strong> to the financing of Turkey, according to the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1458314749324&amp;uri=CELEX:12012E214" target="_blank">Treaty on the Functioning Union, article 214</a>.</p>
<p>In the interests of the UK&#8217;s governmental system and citizens it is imperative that we<strong> leave the EU on June 23</strong>, as to stay in will result in certain suicide, not only for this generation but for the next, and beyond.</p>
<p>Think of your children, their children, and their grand children.</p>

<p>&#8220;It makes sense why Corbyn would be backing the remain in EU camp, because remaining in the EU will mean the end of the British Royal family, it will also mean complete renunciation of democracy and rule by a solid totalitarian dictatorship. These are tenets that Corbyn believes in, and to use Goldman Sachs for his ends is perfectly permissible.&#8221; Robert Pestilence, a Guardian journalist announced on his most recent article.</p>
<p>Socialism works in mysterious ways, however Corbyn is not a fully fledged socialist, watered down with champagne, that he certainly is not. Corbyn is a Marxist, and the EU is a Soviet Marxist construct which he will embrace fully, as will his followers.</p>
<p>One can see Corbyn in a few years, giggling into his grey jumper as the Queen is turfed out of Buckingham palace, and the rest of the Windsors uncermoniously dumped into train wagons sent for processing.</p>
<p>Corbyn is therefore cleverer than he looks.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>The warnings from history are never heeded by the foolish or the blind, as David Cameron is the Neville Chamberlain, Boris Johnson is waiting in the wings to take the reigns from someone who is ultimately too engrossed in their own career to see what the EU is doing.</p>
<p>Jean Claude Juncker wants your sons and daughters to be conscripted in an <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/08/jean-claude-juncker-calls-for-eu-army-european-commission-miltary" target="_blank">EU Army</a>, a singular force away from NATO. The drunkard&#8217;s ambitions are of once again rising the Reich to its previous level against a Russian semi-Sovietized Putin nation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Putin is the Tsar, but he also knows that the Soviet system is the most powerful when it comes to control and unity. The fall of the USSR was a disaster for Russia, because they lost much territory and military strength. The Russian people have been floundering ever since, and the recent sanctions upon Russia by the West show that even though Russia is not Soviet any more, it can suffer greatly outside the Soviet spectrum. What is funny to many Russians however, is that the EU is incorporating full Soviet collectivist techniques in governance and even more funny, is that some elements of the British government want to stay in this evolving decrepit mess. Can you have two Sovietized entities fighting? Of course you can, because one faction always wants the whole piece. Will the winners be the EU Soviet or the Russian Soviet? Naturally, it has always been a European dream to take Russia, from Napoleon to Hitler, they tried, but failed, both because of the winter.&#8221; Vladimir Rustov, a Russian historian and commentator told the BBC.</p>
<p>If Britain stays in the EU, expect your sons and daughters to be eventually drafted to fight in the EU Army. They will not have any choice, and neither will you as a parent. It is quite interesting to see that polls for the upcoming EU Referendum showing the British youth are keen on staying in the EU, obviously the under 30s will be the first to be conscripted to fight, and like lambs to the slaughter they do not know the real facts. Young and naive would be the correct description.</p>
<p>This is why it is madness, and reckless to stay in the EU, because to stay is to throw away not only Britain&#8217;s sovereignty, but its ability to defend itself effectively, as well as throwing away all pretensions of democracy. The totalitarian footstep always marches on in goose step fashion, and the EU is a sovietized state that will get a lot worse in the years to come.</p>
<p>Democracy or Dictatorship. Britain or EU. Freedom or Slavery.</p>
<p>There is no option but to vote for Brexit and let us watch what happens from the sidelines until the path is clear to act.</p>

<p>This ominous Baghdad Spring can only mean one thing, the Shiite militias want to turf America out once and for all and are taking the reigns from the subordinate Shia Vichy government put in place by the U.S.</p>
<p>Already, ISIS has made many in-roads towards Baghdad and are within 50 kms of the city. These facts are not reported by the mainstream media too pre-occupied with election reporting to care, but the augurs do not fare well for Baghdad&#8217;s residents whether in the Green Zone or not.</p>

<p>If Baghdad falls to either faction, the Obama administration would not only have lost most of Iraq but half of Ukraine as well. Obama&#8217;s intransigence towards his own military has definitely not paid off, as America loses all the gains it made globally, and more.</p>
<p>Soon we may see the same scenes the world witnessed in Saigon as Hueys lifted off every few minutes from the U.S. embassy as the Vietcong ambled their way through the streets calmly and with little resistance.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>An increasingly desperate GOP wheeled out Mitt Romney to lambaste Donald Trump on Thursday, an event that spectacularly backfired on the establishment.</p>
<p>You&#8217;d think they were giving a gift to Trump. I&#8217;d say Trump voters tripled in number after the Romney speech because not long after, Trump took the stage and explained point by point how everything Romney said was wrong. Trump then positioned himself as a person being unduly attacked, especially after supporting Romney in the past.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was on the sidelines about Trump but after the Romney speech and then seeing Trump&#8217;s answer, I immediately went to the Trump side,&#8221; Cory Johnsons, 41, a baker from Portland, told local news stations.</p>
<p>Although Romney talked a lot of sense with regards to Trump, it is a sad detriment to the vulgarity of Trump and his fans who will capitalise on the speech.</p>
<p>One has to make two assumptions about GOP: either they are really fucking stupid or they knew the reaction and are actually counting on Trump.</p>
<p>Donald Trump may be a fraud, but he is fooling the American people with impeccable calculating ardour. You may say it is not too hard a task to fool the lemmings lining up at electoral rallies, however there is some merit to Trump&#8217;s technique in pulling the wool over the eyes of the people. GOP may eventually have to settle with Trump, because it will mean having a person at the helm who is good at lying and duping the population whilst smiling like a jackal. A perfect candidate if there ever was one.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>Cue Norman Lamont, Nigel Lawson, Michael Howard.</p>
<p>To the strains of Thin Lizzy&#8217;s epic tune The Boys are Back in Town, these hard hitters are a firm boot in the backside of the relative noob David Cameron and Georgie Osborne.</p>
<p>The level directly concentric to the big boys, we have Gove, IDS, and Boris, a formidable team of established emissaries bidding to open up a serious can of whoop ass on the remain camp.</p>
<p>If one was to establish a fighting force, this would be it, and somehow they gel together.</p>
<p>Although David Cameron has been secretive about his dealings with Tony Blair, Peter Mandelson has been at his side throughout the preparations leading up to EU negotiations. It would not be wrong to guess therefore, that Alistair Campbell or even Gordon Brown have hissed a few words of advice to Cameron during the sell-out period.</p>
<p>Having announced the EU referendum in June, there is a feeling of disquiet across the nation, a certain peace before the storm, as these are still early days.</p>
<p>Preparations are being made, Machiavellian plans are being hatched but there is one certainty; those on the British side are fighting for Britain, they&#8217;re the pilots and Air Marshals who flew and directed operations over the Kent countryside in 1940. The other side who wish to fight against Britain, choose to forget about war heroes who fought for their country instead opting for the role of Luftwaffe and in Mandelson&#8217;s case, the SS.</p>
<p>One last stand. Will Britain prevail? Will it fight? Never surrender should no doubt be the call as Britain rises like a phoenix from the flames of EU purgatory to break free once and for all. Do not forget the sacrifices of those who gave their lives for your freedom and democracy. The EU does not wish to preserve democracy within its dictatorship and to fall into its arms will surely break Britain forever.</p>
<p>Always remember this: Once Britain is gone..it&#8217;s <strong>gone</strong>. Never Give Up! Never Surrender!</p>
<p>Onward..</p>

<p>This treasonous fact, seems to be dusted under the carpet, but it is intrinsically true.</p>
<p>The In campaign of the EU Referendum led by the PM is effectively working against Britain&#8217;s interests, its security, its sovereignty and ultimately the monarchy.</p>
<p>If Britain stays in the EU, the monarchy may be abolished by the orders of the European Union. Under the EU&#8217;s collectivist strategy, much of the land that the current monarchy owns now under the Crown, would be subject to confiscation by the EU and opened up to the public, effectively abolishing thousands of years of British royal heritage.</p>
<p>There are most certainly plans within the EU to halt the British monarchy after Queen Elizabeth II&#8217;s reign, and where would this leave the successors of her majesty? Funding to the monarchy within the EU would either be halted or severely cut.</p>
<p>The royal house of Windsor is seen as a major threat to the EU because it still holds some constitutional power, and every law has to be passed ultimately by the Queen. The EU wishes to take away Britain&#8217;s sovereignty completely, and David Cameron is pushing for the complete dissolution of the monarchy in the long run.</p>
<p>William Joyce (Lord Haw Haw) was the last person to be hanged for High Treason in 1946, and although capital punishment has been outlawed in Britain since 1965, today the maximum punishment for high treason is a long stretch in prison, since the Crime and Disorder Act of 1998.</p>
<ul>

<p>If David Cameron loses his bid to commit high treason against the state and the monarchy, he may find himself in prison for a very long time.</p>
<p>It is not just the highest echelons of political office who are thus at risk here, but the people who are vocally calling for Britain to stay In the EU who are also at risk. In the future, they themselves may be targeted as unreliable, as treasonous vermin, and as traitors to Britain. You are being tracked on twitter, on Facebook or wherever you voice your tawdry treasonous opinion, and if the future is Out of the EU, you will be remembered, as will the treasonous members of parliament who chose the side of Britain&#8217;s dissolution and surrender to the enemy.</p>
<p>To be hanged, drawn and quartered was the punishment for treason hundreds of years ago, and the four corners of Britain would display the remains of the traitor rotting on spikes, displayed for all to see.</p>

I squashed grassroots Tories and expelled half of my Cabinet. I consorted with the enemy i.e. Tony Blair and the dark Lord Mandelson. I alienated 80% of the Tory party and have shit on the people of Britain and their history, but frankly I do not care, because I am right and everyone else is wrong.

<p>Why are the likes of David Cameron and his evil Eurocentric cronies acting like a bunch of totalitarian tin pot dictators? The answer is in the EU, Britain is being swallowed up by the totalitarian pseudo-fascist EU Marxist state, and Dave just doesn&#8217;t give a shit in hiding it any more.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish to make it even more unpleasant to live in the UK. We will search your homes, listen to your calls and track you wherever you may go. We will do this because we&#8217;re staying in the EU and they make the orders here now,&#8221; Cameron told the BBC sneering down at the camera.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister detests the British people, and is not only willing to sell them down the river with his traitorous villainy but he doesn&#8217;t trust you one bit either. You may be innocent, never committed a crime in your life, but you will still be treated like a criminal from birth to death.</p>
<p>Bringing in the snoopers charter is one step closer to the real EU plan, and Cameron&#8217;s treason against Britain and its people will be apparent in a few years time when people will be made to just disappear.</p>
<p>&#8220;The EU Snoopers Charter will be used to sniff out any dissent to the EU. They will come in the early hours of the morning for you wearing black masks. Bundling you into an unmarked van, you will be taken to an area for processing before interrogation and then liquidation. Dissent against the totalitarian state will not be permitted,&#8221; an unnamed EU official revealed before slinking back into the shadows giggling like a hyena.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>Business leaders and economists all agree, the initial shock on leaving may well be a hardy journey to traverse, mainly because the EU&#8217;s two year control period, in which it will seek to damage the UK further, but once the chains are lifted, the UK would be set free once again to do as it did for centuries before it was enslaved.</p>
<p>Yes, there are many horror stories being bandied about by the Project Fear emissaries of terror, however no one is saying that life would be all roses outside the EU, the truth is it won&#8217;t be easy, however once Britain recovers from the shackles of the EU it would prosper as it has for millennia.</p>
<p>Britain always comes out on top whatever happens, it is this spirit of adversity that put the Great into Britain.</p>
<p>Outside of the EU, there are thousands of free trade agreements, whether multi-lateral or bilateral. There is the Commonwealth and the Anglo-nations. Britain would once again forge closer ties with India, North America and the Far East and whoever else wants to trade. New trading agreements can always be made up, bigger, better, more lucrative for all parties. The globe is an open opportunity and Britain does not have to be constrained to one tiny area of the world. Think globally, as the Victorians did, not closed off and limited in horizons.</p>
<p>Britain leaving the EU, will not mean that Europe trade will suddenly cease, as deals will continue, and even though the EU may be spiteful and want Britain to fail, they will most certainly put a few obstacles in its way to show the rest of the EU countries that leaving is bad.</p>
<p>The EU is most of all afraid of a strong Britain. They also do not want a country prospering outside the EU, because of contagion to other imprisoned states within its control mechanism.</p>
<p>There is no doubt, that there will be an initial shock to the system, but this would be a good shock, as the chains holding Britain would be broken. An emancipation, and a New beginning from slavery and limitation as the EU&#8217;s whipping boy.</p>
<p>Fuck the EU dear friends, and let us look ahead to good times, free, free from the shackles, the trade limits, the quotas, the Brussels red-tape and the ridiculous diktats inhibiting Britain.</p>
<p>Great Britain is bigger than the pox-ridden EU, and the EU knows it. That&#8217;s why they&#8217;re scared right now.</p>
<p>BREAK FREE! Once and for all!</p>

<p>Demand for over the counter self defence products rose in response to the massive sex assaults, brutal gang rapes, and thefts in Cologne and Hamburg on New Year&#8217;s Eve.</p>
<p>The Japanese device can be used by multiple women on the same person, and is proving so useful that production has increased to cope with the massive demand.</p>
<p>Reminiscent of something you would find in a live-action superhero television show, the net launcher is a handheld device that shoots out a net projectile.</p>
<p>The launcher is reloadable and has two different net cartridges. One type of cartridge just fires out a net. The other type of cartridge fires out a net with a line that can be pulled.</p>
<p>The launcher has a built-in alarm to alert others that the device has been fired. The net can be fired from 2 to 3 meters from the intended target.</p>
<div class="copy-paste-block" style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="http://www.liveleak.com/ll_embed?f=26a3359a1cdc" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<p>When two or more nets are used together, the sex crazed migrant will be completely engulfed in netting and will have a very difficult time trying to escape.</p>
<p>The Japanese company is also planning to introduce a metallic net that will electrocute the assailant once the device is released.</p>
<p>Ichi Yoshimitsu, CEO for the company said: &#8220;Once the threat is neutralised by the net, we also administer 60,000 volts intermittently onto the person until the police eventually arrive.&#8221;</p>
<p>German women will need the devices more than ever now as an extra 10 million Arabs are set to arrive in Germany by 2017.</p>

<p>Few historical figures in English history exemplify this country more than Shakespeare and this is why the discovery of this manuscript carries such import.</p>
<p>Professor Richard Charringcross, who headed the research team, discovered the manuscript hidden in a hole positioned directly behind the poet&#8217;s privy.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe this is the area where Shakespeare wrote his best stuff. He would come here, sit down and bang, the creative juices would flow as he plopped and strained away the day&#8217;s mundane troubles,&#8221; professor Charringcross revealed in his new documentary, to be aired on BBC7 in March.</p>
<p>The text of the manuscript reveals a glimpse into Britain&#8217;s future, and is a sort of call to arms for the English people to resist the EU Referendum In calls from the &#8220;artless spur-galled puttocks&#8221; that are so intent on selling off the country to the &#8220;mad mustachio purple-hued maltworms&#8221; that tout their wares &#8220;like one of our French wither&#8217;d pears: it looks ill, it eats drily&#8221;.</p>
<p>Shakespeare then goes on to describe a person that remarkably sounds like David Cameron, &#8221; I scorn you, scurvy Camo-Maroon. What, you poor, base, rascally, cheating, lack-linen treachurist! Away, you mouldy rogue, away!&#8221;</p>
<p>As for Jean Claude Juncker, Shakespeare leaves no doubt about his credentials, &#8220;..Junk&#8217;er, a most notable coward, an infinite and endless liar, an hourly promise breaker, the owner of no one good quality.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>The full manuscript will be revealed when the documentary airs in March on BBC7.</em></p>

<p>&#8220;Trump is the gift that keeps giving. We don&#8217;t want a proper Republican candidate so Trump is being moved forwards for a very good reason. Once he&#8217;s nominated, that&#8217;s when we bring out the real dirt,&#8221; a Democrat insider revealed.</p>
<p>Looks like for now, the circus is in town and the unveiling of Sarah Palin, the eternally geographically challenged dipsical lobotomy is pure entertainment.</p>
<p>Sit back, break out the popcorn, the Schlitz, and enjoy the ridiculous show.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Il Duce, was a great man, and he was a strong man. I am inspired by his life and how he changed Italy for the better. This is what I want for America,&#8221; Mr Trump told CNN on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Benito Mussolini was the founder of fascism, and was instrumental in the deaths of millions of people in World War II, but that does not seem to phase Trump, who aspires to bring a totalitarian regime to the United States as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s face it, there will be a period, like Mussolini&#8217;s when he was prime minister of Italy, where he ruled constitutionally until 1925, but soon after he thought, screw this, let&#8217;s have a full dictatorship. I&#8217;m not saying we&#8217;re going to have an immediate dictatorship in America when I&#8217;m president, but I&#8217;ll give it a little time, maybe a year or two. Business is business, I gotta do what I gotta do, and I&#8217;m going to clean house, whatever it takes. Fascism is great because you don&#8217;t have to answer to anyone, you just do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Will Trump eventually end up like his hero, hanging from a post?</p>

<p>&#8220;Because of the scrapping of this deal, anyone who now comes into the UK is barred from deportation, could be a hate preacher, a rapist or a murderer, plus migrants are not constrained by having to claim asylum only in the first country of entry as it was before,&#8221; a smiling EU technocrat said whilst enjoying a filet mignon at an expensive Brussels restaurant.</p>
<p>Meanwhile back in Britain, a subservient spittle sniffer prime minister, quietly acquiesced to the reneging of the Dublin deal and simply shrugged his shoulders, much like Neville Chamberlain did when he came back from Germany singing the praises of Herr Hitler all those years ago.</p>
<p>David Cameron is Neville Chamberlain, and unless someone with some fucking balls comes in to mend this almighty mess, we will all be goose stepping soon.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>As the resident market expert at the Daily Squib, I am used to people asking me questions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, Bill, when&#8217;s the market going to stop falling?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s looking good right now to buy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is my pension safe, the market just dropped by 34%?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The markets are regulated right, you know after what happened to Bear Stearns and Lehman?&#8221;</p>
<p>I only have one answer for these people, and that&#8217;s never listen to the news, because once you hear it there it&#8217;s already history.</p>
<p>Do your own research is my best answer, because if you don&#8217;t have the data, the numbers, the staff to do all the number crunching and sift through the data, forget about it.</p>
<p>By the time the big banks and regulators know what&#8217;s going on, the event already happened.</p>
<p>You see folks, after the 2008 bailouts, the taxpayer ate it, and the bankers got a pay off from your hard earned cash, they just went back to doing what they were doing before the crash. That&#8217;s why this is happening again right now, and it&#8217;s only going to get worse.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/1929-2014-DJIA.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-10066 aligncenter" src="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/1929-2014-DJIA.jpg" alt="1929-2016 DJIA" width="360" height="221" /></a></p>
<p>To understand the markets, you have to understand how avalanches work, first you need some noise, or a little too much snow on the mountain, then the top rolls down, accumulating speed and momentum, maybe it stops a little here or there, there may be a big rock somewhere, but that snow keeps coming, and coming until gravity and momentum do their job and the snow sees the bottom of the mountain. The bigger the mountain, the bigger the avalanche.</p>
<p><strong>Short</strong></p>
<p>Now the shorters in the market, the big boys were waiting for awhile for this to happen, the pumping of false cash into the market made it rise, but they knew that there was no substance to this rise. When the jobs data is falsified, when the derivatives keep getting piled on and on, when the unfunded Federal debt liabilities are at $130 Trillion and the Obama deficit is at $22 Trillion, there is no way this can be resolved mathematically, or physically.</p>
<p>QE4 I hear you shout! Is that the answer? Not really folks because QE4 means Armageddon is postponed for maybe a few months, but even QE4 won&#8217;t do much, especially with interest rates near zero still and no room to manoeuvre.</p>
<p>Hey I know, let&#8217;s invade <a href="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/us_military_bases_surrounding_iran_.jpg" target="_blank">Iran</a>. Close&#8230;war could be the answer to all of our problems but this time, it would not be against some defenceless paper tiger like Iraq, but Russia, China and Iran. Big problem there.</p>
<p>Anyway, how long is a piece of string? You can have all the quants you want trying to work things out, the question is, where does it end, and can you stop it?</p>
<p>No. Not this time. No lessons were learned the last time, so why should now be any different?</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>According to a <a href="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Trump-Ku-Klux-Klan.jpg" target="_blank">1927 New York Times edition</a>, Donald Trump&#8217;s dad was a prominent member of the KKK, and his son, Donald J. Trump is no better.</p>
<p>&#8220;My daddy would say, lookee over here, there goes another &#8216;boy&#8217;. One day, when you become president son, first you gotta trick them negroes to think you like them, then you gotta win and stick &#8217;em back in the ground where they belong,&#8221; Trump told one of his acolytes during a pre-rally briefing.</p>
<p>Trickery doesn&#8217;t come cheap for most presidential candidates, but for Trump, to win, pulling the wool over the eyes of African Americans has been easier than he thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;I got some of these people coming up to me and saying they&#8217;ll vote for me. If only they knew. Like I&#8217;m laughing inside, but I give &#8217;em a big smile and carry on with the show,&#8221; Trump detailed.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2SnByRPbDDM" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Certainly, Trump has a huge following of African Americans, blinded by the lies and cheap rhetoric, but at the end of the day, blacks in America would pay a heavy price for a Trump win.</p>
<p>Neil Zlozower, a reporter for KACS news in Arkansas is well informed on the situation: &#8220;You got people like Farakhan endorsing Trump, little does that idiot know that the Ku Klux Klan is pulling the strings on this one. Trump is a stone cold racist, he sees blacks as slaves, as low value workers, low information voters, and basically made up of the intelligence level of goats, that&#8217;s the beauty of the situation we got now. We got blacks endorsing Trump, when Trump is laughing like a hyena right in their face, they&#8217;re worshipping him. Who played who? I say Trump&#8217;s the winner here, he&#8217;s taking the black vote and adding it up to his roster, he don&#8217;t care about blacks because soon they&#8217;ll be shining his shoes all the way to the presidency.&#8221;</p>

Why are there no Polynesian actors nominated? Because the English speaking world is primarily for those people. Why do black actors want to hijack something, why don&#8217;t they go back to Africa and build their own film industry?&#8221; an industry insider in Hollywood revealed on Monday.</p>
<p>The truth is that people have had enough of the incessant moaning, the hijacking of everything by blacks in the entertainment industry and the world in general. Since Obama has become president, the hijacking of pretty much every genre of everything has been de rigueur, enabled by an administration that puts blacks above any other race.</p>
<p>What about Tibetans? Are they not humans, are they not good actors and actresses? What about Chinese or Japanese actors, or Indians? What about Arabic, or Turkish actors? There are some great actors in South America. Why does it just have to always be about black actors? There are other races in the world apart from entitled blacks, who seem to shout the loudest for everything and display little or no talent to back it up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone has had enough of rap films, ghettoised cop films and all the other hip hop culture films. No one wants to watch that apart from dumbed down low intelligence troglodytes. Besides, watch any mainstream big studio Hollywood film, and you will see tonnes of black actors portraying people in positions of power, let&#8217;s reference Morgan Freeman and Samuel L. Jackson as two such actors. The former referenced actor is always the all-American father figure, the latter is always the wheeler-dealer African American. You buy a used car from Samuel L. Jackson? Hell no, he&#8217;ll convince you to get in the boot, take it round the corner and put a few caps in yo ass so you don&#8217;t blab,&#8221; another industry person revealed.</p>
<p>One angry former Hollywood executive said: &#8220;Stop hijacking! Don&#8217;t impose yourself on people that do not want to see your face on the screen. Instead blacks should create their own film industry where they can indulge in their own dreams. There&#8217;s only so much black culture the rest of society can take.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Our brave sailors got away unscathed. In the navy, Yes, you can sail the seven seas. In the navy, Yes, you can put your mind at ease.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to show the world that girls can do things just as good as the boys,&#8221; Jenner said at her training circuit in Beverly Hills.</p>
<p>Caitlyn Jenner has a gruelling training session and gets up at three in the morning to run. The Decathlon is a serious event, and to compete with the best, she has some great trainers to help her.</p>
<p>Along with the shot put, long jump, high jump and pole vault, there&#8217;s the 1,500 metres which really is the test that will count.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a lot of upper body strength especially for the shot put. I&#8217;m getting 13.80 right now but hope to stretch it to 14.40 by the end of summer,&#8221; Jenner told reporters.</p>
<p>To prove his strength in the event, Jenner picked up a female reporter and threw her across some grass, the CNN reporter took the display in her stride and whooped with joy at the playful act.</p>
<p>Team USA has a real winner in Brazil this year and the bets are on for Jenner going for gold.</p>

Under newly introduced executive orders presented by president Obama, this would deem seventy percent of America&#8217;s population as illegible to own guns through mental illness filters and restrictions.</p>
<p>According to vice president, Joe Biden, the Second Amendment of the U.S Constitution Bill of Rights &#8216;says that you can limit who can own a gun&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0VAJl_RJ574" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&#8220;If you&#8217;re popping pills every day to get by, you are effectively classified as mentally unstable, because you can&#8217;t cope with life without your mental medication. People who take prescription drugs are also liable to exhibit unhinged behaviour as these pharmaceuticals permanently alter the brain&#8217;s chemistry,&#8221; an adviser and physician working with the Institute of Drug Classification in consultation with the Obama adminsitration revealed on Tuesday.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It&#8217;s not just prescription drugs which also could meddle with gun ownership, drugs like marijuana and any other recreational drug use would also limit gun ownership.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&#8220;People who take recreational drugs, and alcohol are also classified under this ruling, and would thus also be restricted in gun ownership. If you take prescription drugs and also use illegal drugs, you got double jeopardy there. You are skewed mentally, under the influence of multiple drugs, and we can find these substances in your blood even after abstinence. If you own a gun, we will revoke your license, if you want to purchase a gun, you will be refused,&#8221; the physician added.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Mental health evaluations could now become mandatory for all citizens within the United States, a leading legislator in Washington is advising. If this is the case, 90% of the U.S. population could be banned from owning guns.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>On the one hand, there are the Euro-skeptics, and on the other are the Europhiles, so what did Churchill really want to happen in Europe post-war?</p>
<p>Contrary to belief, Sir Winston Churchill was for a global government, and he specifically wanted a union between France and Britain in forming a European Union. However, what was envisaged as an Anglo-Franco union by Churchill in his speech at the Albert Hall in 1947, has never materialised. We instead have a Franco-Germanic union within the EU, for they are the core players. To this end, these two entities have chosen to isolate Britain, to flood these islands with millions of people from outside of Europe and cause the country&#8217;s essential services to buckle with the strain. Churchill would not have been happy to have seen the deterioration in Britain we are seeing today, caused mainly by the Franco-Germanic alliance working against Britain.</p>
<p>Nearing the time of his death, Churchill was sad about the decline of the British Empire, especially the loss of India, but the spectre of a Soviet threat was analogous to the desire to create a counterpoint to the threat from the East.</p>
<p>Churchill&#8217;s political stance wavered many times, at one time joining the Liberal Democrats, and then returning to the Conservative party, and so his attitude towards the EU would have equally wavered if he was around today, and witnessed what union has done to modern day Britain.</p>
<p>Europhiles within Britain will oft quote Churchill when espousing the positive points of the European Union, however they do not understand the man at all or the times we are in at this very point.</p>
<p>The Middle East is in turmoil, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3393551/Only-10-migrants-reached-Europe-far-claims-German-development-minister-warns-ten-million-people-way.html" target="_blank">millions</a> of refugees are flooding to Europe and the threat from Russia has not dissipated despite the fall of the Soviet Union. We are in fact, in a state of (proxy) war, and Churchill, if he were alive would have addressed this issue with great volition. Instead, our current leaders are caught in the headlights, they are preoccupied with their project of union, when this project is being attacked daily from multiple angles. To have union, you must have peace, prosperity, of which we have none, the world is instead on the brink of economic collapse and war.</p>
<p>If Churchill were alive today, he would abhor Cameron&#8217;s vapid, duplicitous stance, and he would baulk at the way the British citizens themselves are being treated, not only by the EU, but by their own politicians. To ignore the people is to ignore political office, and to ignore what is going on in the Middle East is a death sentence for all civilisation. Cameron is weak, he is not an International thinker but a man only concerned for his minor role in sealing his tenure as leader of the Conservative party and his reputation.</p>
<p>The disingenuous workings of the Europhiles in selling off Britain will backfire, the British people do not want this EU mess, simply because it is not what was sold to Britain. European union should mean prosperity, not poverty, overcrowding, flooding of benefits seeking migrants, ludicrous diktats and a totalitarian expensive shambles ruled by unelected overpaid profligate technocrats.</p>
<p>Britain will always embrace the open sea, but why should it embrace imprisonment in a union of disunion? That is what the EU is now, it is falling apart, an almighty clutter that has lost its vision, led by idiots, megalomaniacs and freeloaders.</p>
<p>Did the real spirit of Britain die with Churchill? We shall find out soon enough..</p>

<p>&#8220;Every speech that David Cameron does regarding Europe and the EU now is one that effectively gives away Britain&#8217;s sovereignty. It is therefore quite probable and accurate to say that he would have had no qualms about selling off Britain to the Nazis during <a href="https://youtu.be/pfSqp-755KE" target="_blank">WW2</a>,&#8221; professor Dean Arkwright revealed in the analytical research paper.</p>
<p>Collaborators with the Nazis during the war were not looked upon kindly as were other sympathisers of the Nazi regime.</p>
<p>The full study and its findings will be revealed after the EU referendum which may or may not be held this year.</p>

<p>&#8220;We had to consult experts from America about the chair. It is an original electric chair used against convicts in the 1950s and will administer real electric shocks to the participants. Our legal experts also were consulted as well as the agents of the celebrities. The electric shocks they will receive will not be life threatening but give enough voltage to sear their hair and skin, so it is a serious challenge,&#8221; Croft added.</p>

<p>According to all news organisations, what the internet &#8216;feels&#8217; at any time is a news worthy story.</p>
<p>How the hell do you know what the internet feels anyway? This terrible situation first occurred when some scurrilous media company claimed that Kim Kardashian&#8217;s buttocks &#8216;broke the internet&#8217; but nothing was further than the truth. Okay, maybe twitter, a fast moving rambling maelstrom of words was spammed by the images for a few minutes, but this does not equate to &#8216;breaking&#8217; anything. In reality, the Kardashians are a mere speckle of faeces in the universe of things, they will not be remembered, no one will care about them in the future, it will be as if they never existed, if only that were true, that they never existed; as for the internet, since when has spamming been an acceptable practice?</p>
<p>We therefore suggest that the internet is a vast platform, and no single news story can completely encompass its girth at any given time. There will be some sections which embrace certain stories, and others which completely ignore what is going on in any given circle or geographic, cultural location.</p>
<p>Next time you see a headline about what the &#8216;internet&#8217; is feeling, or reacting to, just ignore it, because the next few seconds, and it&#8217;s all forgotten, such is the low-attention span of the fucking internet.</p>

<p>Business people like Trump, Murdoch and Sugar are not well read, they&#8217;re just good at knocking heads together and coming up with impulsive ideas for their business. They want things done fast, and if it doesn&#8217;t happen, you&#8217;re fired because you&#8217;re an underling and they&#8217;re the &#8216;boss&#8217;.</p>
<p>Politics is a different game altogether, especially in the UK, where one plays the long game, you certainly cannot wear your heart on your sleeve, instead having an ability to act will hold you in good stead.</p>
<p>Diplomacy is key to all situations, even in heated debate, as well as an encyclopaedic knowledge of whatever you are discussing a la your researchers.</p>
<p>Someone like Trump is not well-read he is a bully boy, a person whose ego far extends his knowledge base and this is why he will fall into every trap without realising. Someone like him is doomed from the get go, simply because politics is not like business.</p>
<p>Sure, Trump appeals to the lowest common denominator of the American populace, and his support base proves that fascism is alive and well in America as much as extremist Islam, but his twitter style of delivery is a limited method of governance where every emotion is conveyed however idiotic and ill-thought out.</p>
<p>The reason that Trump is now enjoying a poll rating of 40% is simply that Trump&#8217;s insular jingoism appeals to a good number of Americans. Trump has little or no understanding of global politics and nations outside the U.S. and neither do most Americans. Therefore, this profound ignorance and black and white rhetoric naturally appeals to the every day Joe who has never been out of whatever State they were born in, and will most probably die there too. One would therefore wish that someone like Trump keeps up with his support for as long as is needed, the fool does not realise that he is the gift that keeps giving.</p>
<p>Trump is cashing in on the profound ignorance and ill education of the American population. As much as the seasoned politician may baulk at Trump&#8217;s rise, they will know that to build a tower on a foundation of ignorance is dangerous, and Trump will fall faster than a brick when he makes his next ignorant, uneducated, childish remark.</p>
<p>Thugs don&#8217;t read books, a Trump is a brute, a bully who has only risen to the top through ties with the Mafiosi. All it will take is some more information on these ties, and Trump will disappear as fast as he appeared, like a turd in the wind, a messy flush back into the sewer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Christianity has been the cause of more murder and hatred in the world than any religion, especially when used by people like me. Hitler himself was <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Religious_views_of_Adolf_Hitler" target="_blank">Christian</a> and he murdered over 6 million Jews in World War II. This is why I want Christianity banned as well as Islam,&#8221; Trump told an audience of supporters in Milwaukee on Tuesday.</p>
<p>During his speech, Mr Trump distributed leaflets showing the amount of deaths the Christian religion has been responsible for throughout history.</p>

</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">The Archbishop of Tyre, eye-witness, wrote: &#8220;It was impossible to look upon the vast numbers of the slain without horror; everywhere lay fragments of human bodies, and the very ground was covered with the blood of the slain. It was not alone the spectacle of headless bodies and mutilated limbs strewn in all directions that roused the horror of all who looked upon them. Still more dreadful was it to gaze upon the victors themselves, dripping with blood from head to foot, an ominous sight which brought terror to all who met them. It is reported that within the Temple enclosure alone about ten thousand infidels perished.&#8221; [TG79]</div>

<div align="justify">Beginning with Columbus (a former slave trader and would-be Holy Crusader) the conquest of the New World began, as usual understood as a means to propagate Christianity.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">Within hours of landfall on the first inhabited island he encountered in the Caribbean, Columbus seized and carried off six native people who, he said, &#8220;ought to be good servants &#8230; [and] would easily be made Christians, because it seemed to me that they belonged to no religion.&#8221; [SH200]<br />
While Columbus described the Indians as &#8220;idolators&#8221; and &#8220;slaves, as many as [the Crown] shall order,&#8221; his pal Michele de Cuneo, Italian nobleman, referred to the natives as &#8220;beasts&#8221; because &#8220;they eat when they are hungry,&#8221; and made love &#8220;openly whenever they feel like it.&#8221; [SH204-205]</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">On every island he set foot on, Columbus planted a cross, &#8220;making the declarations that are required&#8221; &#8211; the <i>requerimiento</i> &#8211; to claim the ownership for his Catholic patrons in Spain. And &#8220;nobody objected.&#8221; If the Indians refused or delayed their acceptance (or understanding), the <i>requerimiento</i> continued:</div>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">I certify to you that, with the help of God, we shall powerfully enter in your country and shall make war against you &#8230; and shall subject you to the yoke and obedience of the Church &#8230; and shall do you all mischief that we can, as to vassals who do not obey and refuse to receive their lord and resist and contradict him.&#8221; [SH66]</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<div align="justify">Likewise in the words of John Winthrop, first governor of Massachusetts Bay Colony: &#8220;justifieinge the undertakeres of the intended Plantation in New England &#8230; to carry the Gospell into those parts of the world, &#8230; and to raise a Bulworke against the kingdome of the Ante-Christ.&#8221; [SH235]</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">In average two thirds of the native population were killed by colonist-imported smallpox before violence began. This was a great sign of &#8220;the marvelous goodness and providence of God&#8221; to the Christians of course, e.g. the Governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony wrote in 1634, as &#8220;for the natives, they are near all dead of the smallpox, so as the Lord hath cleared our title to what we possess.&#8221; [SH109,238]</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">On Hispaniola alone, on Columbus visits, the native population (Arawak), a rather harmless and happy people living on an island of abundant natural resources, a literal paradise, soon mourned 50,000 dead. [SH204]</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">The surviving Indians fell victim to rape, murder, enslavement and Spanish raids.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">As one of the culprits wrote: &#8220;So many Indians died that they could not be counted, all through the land the Indians lay dead everywhere. The stench was very great and pestiferous.&#8221; [SH69]</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">The Indian chief Hatuey fled with his people but was captured and burned alive. As &#8220;they were tying him to the stake a Franciscan friar urged him to take Jesus to his heart so that his soul might go to heaven, rather than descend into hell. Hatuey replied that if heaven was where the Christians went, he would rather go to hell.&#8221; [SH70]</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">What happened to his people was described by an eyewitness:<br />
&#8220;The Spaniards found pleasure in inventing all kinds of odd cruelties &#8230; They built a long gibbet, long enough for the toes to touch the ground to prevent strangling, and hanged thirteen [natives] at a time in honour of Christ Our Saviour and the twelve Apostles&#8230; then, straw was wrapped around their torn bodies and they were burned alive.&#8221; [SH72]<br />
Or, on another occasion:<br />
&#8220;The Spaniards cut off the arm of one, the leg or hip of another, and from some their heads at one stroke, like butchers cutting up beef and mutton for market. Six hundred, including the Cacique, were thus slain like brute beasts&#8230;Vasco [de Balboa] ordered forty of them to be torn to pieces by dogs.&#8221; [SH83]</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">The &#8220;island&#8217;s population of about eight million people at the time of Columbus&#8217;s arrival in 1492 already had declined by a third to a half before the year 1496 was out.&#8221; Eventually all the island&#8217;s natives were exterminated, so the Spaniards were &#8220;forced&#8221; to import slaves from other Caribbean islands, who soon suffered the same fate. Thus &#8220;the Caribbean&#8217;s millions of native people [were] thereby effectively liquidated in barely a quarter of a century&#8221;. [SH72-73] &#8220;In less than the normal lifetime of a single human being, an entire culture of millions of people, thousands of years resident in their homeland, had been exterminated.&#8221; [SH75]</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">&#8220;And then the Spanish turned their attention to the mainland of Mexico and Central America. The slaughter had barely begun. The exquisite city of Tenochtitln [Mexico city] was next.&#8221; [SH75]</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">Cortez, Pizarro, De Soto and hundreds of other Spanish conquistadors likewise sacked southern and Mesoamerican civilizations in the name of Christ (De Soto also sacked Florida).</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">&#8220;When the 16th century ended, some 200,000 Spaniards had moved to the Americas. By that time probably more than 60,000,000 natives were dead.&#8221; [SH95]</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p align="justify">Of course no different were the founders of what today is the US of A.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div align="justify">Although none of the settlers would have survived winter without native help, they soon set out to expel and exterminate the Indians. Warfare among (north American) Indians was rather harmless, in comparison to European standards, and was meant to avenge insults rather than conquer land. In the words of some of the pilgrim fathers: &#8220;Their Warres are farre less bloudy&#8230;&#8221;, so that there usually was &#8220;no great slawter of nether side&#8221;. Indeed, &#8220;they might fight seven yeares and not kill seven men.&#8221; What is more, the Indians usually spared women and children. [SH111]</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">In the spring of 1612 some English colonists found life among the (generally friendly and generous) natives attractive enough to leave Jamestown &#8211; &#8220;being idell &#8230; did runne away unto the Indyans,&#8221; &#8211; to live among them.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">&#8220;Governor Thomas Dale had them hunted down and executed: &#8216;Some he apointed (sic) to be hanged Some burned Some to be broken upon wheles, others to be staked and some shott to deathe&#8217;.&#8221; [SH105] Of course these elegant measures were restricted for fellow Englishmen: &#8220;This was the treatment for those who wished to act like Indians. For those who had no choice in the matter, because they were the native people of Virginia&#8221; methods were different: &#8220;when an Indian was accused by an Englishman of stealing a cup and failing to return it, the English response was to attack the natives in force, burning the entire community&#8221; down. [SH105]</div>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<div align="justify">On the territory that is now Massachusetts the founding fathers of the colonies were committing genocide, in what has become known as the &#8220;Peqout War&#8221;. The killers were New England Puritan Christians, refugees from persecution in their own home country England.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">When however, a dead colonist was found, apparently killed by Narragansett Indians, the Puritan colonists wanted revenge. Despite the Indian chief&#8217;s pledge they attacked.<br />
Somehow they seem to have lost the idea of what they were after, because when they were greeted by Pequot Indians (long-time foes of the Narragansetts) the troops nevertheless made war on the Pequots and burned their villages.<br />
The puritan commander-in-charge John Mason after one massacre wrote: &#8220;And indeed such a dreadful Terror did the Almighty let fall upon their Spirits, that they would fly from us and run into the very Flames, where many of them perished &#8230; God was above them, who laughed his Enemies and the Enemies of his People to Scorn, making them as a fiery Oven &#8230; Thus did the Lord judge among the Heathen, filling the Place with dead Bodies&#8221;: men, women, children. [SH113-114]</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">So &#8220;the Lord was pleased to smite our Enemies in the hinder Parts, and to give us their land for an inheritance&#8221;. [SH111].</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">Because of his readers&#8217; assumed knowledge of Deuteronomy, there was no need for Mason to quote the words that immediately follow:<br />
&#8220;Thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth. But thou shalt utterly destroy them&#8230;&#8221; (Deut 20)</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">Mason&#8217;s comrade Underhill recalled how &#8220;great and doleful was the bloody sight to the view of the young soldiers&#8221; yet reassured his readers that &#8220;sometimes the Scripture declareth women and children must perish with their parents&#8221;. [SH114]</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">Other Indians were killed in successful plots of poisoning. The colonists even had dogs especially trained to kill Indians and to devour children from their mothers breasts, in the colonists&#8217; own words: &#8220;blood Hounds to draw after them, and Mastives to seaze them.&#8221; (This was inspired by Spanish methods of the time)<br />
In this way they continued until the extermination of the Pequots was near. [SH107-119]</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">The surviving handful of Indians &#8220;were parceled out to live in servitude. John Endicott and his pastor wrote to the governor asking for &#8216;a share&#8217; of the captives, specifically &#8216;a young woman or girle and a boy if you thinke good&#8217;.&#8221; [SH115]</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">Other tribes were to follow the same path.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">Comment the Christian exterminators: &#8220;God&#8217;s Will, which will at last give us cause to say: How Great is His Goodness! and How Great is his Beauty!&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Thus doth the Lord Jesus make them to bow before him, and to lick the Dust!&#8221; [TA]</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">Like today, lying was OK to Christians then. &#8220;Peace treaties were signed with every intention to violate them: when the Indians &#8216;grow secure uppon (sic) the treatie&#8217;, advised the Council of State in Virginia, &#8216;we shall have the better Advantage both to surprise them, &amp; cutt downe theire Corne&#8217;.&#8221; [SH106]</div>

<li>
<div align="justify">In 1624 sixty heavily armed Englishmen cut down 800 defenceless Indian men, women and children. [SH107]</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">In a single massacre in &#8220;King Philip&#8217;s War&#8221; of 1675 and 1676 some &#8220;600 Indians were destroyed. A delighted Cotton Mather, revered pastor of the Second Church in Boston, later referred to the slaughter as a &#8216;barbeque&#8217;.&#8221; [SH115]</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">To summarize: Before the arrival of the English, the western Abenaki people in New Hampshire and Vermont had numbered 12,000. Less than half a century later about 250 remained alive &#8211; a destruction rate of 98%. The Pocumtuck people had numbered more than 18,000, fifty years later they were down to 920 &#8211; 95% destroyed. The Quiripi-Unquachog people had numbered about 30,000, fifty years later they were down to 1500 &#8211; 95% destroyed. The Massachusetts people had numbered at least 44,000, fifty years later barely 6000 were alive &#8211; 81% destroyed. [SH118] These are only a few examples of the multitude of tribes living before Christian colonists set their foot on the New World. All this was before the smallpox epidemics of 1677 and 1678 had occurred. And the carnage was not over then.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">All the above was only the beginning of the European colonization, it was before the frontier age actually had begun.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="justify">A total of maybe more than 150 million Indians (of both Americas) were destroyed in the period of 1500 to 1900, as an average two thirds by smallpox and other epidemics, that leaves some 50 million killed directly by violence, bad treatment and slavery.</div>

<li>
<div align="justify">In many countries, such as Brazil, and Guatemala, this continues even today.</div>

<h3 align="justify">More Glorious events in US history</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<div align="justify">Reverend Solomon Stoddard, one of New England&#8217;s most esteemed religious leaders, in &#8220;1703 formally proposed to the Massachusetts Governor that the colonists be given the financial wherewithal to purchase and train large packs of dogs &#8216;to hunt Indians as they do bears&#8217;.&#8221; [SH241]</div>

<div align="justify"><a href="http://www.legendsofamerica.com/na-sandcreek.html" target="_blank">Massacre of Sand Creek</a>, Colorado 11/29/1864. Colonel John Chivington, a former Methodist minister and still elder in the church (&#8220;I long to be wading in gore&#8221;) had a Cheyenne village of about 600, mostly women and children, gunned down despite the chiefs&#8217; waving with a white flag: 400-500 killed.<br />
From an eye-witness account: &#8220;There were some thirty or forty squaws collected in a hole for protection; they sent out a little girl about six years old with a white flag on a stick; she had not proceeded but a few steps when she was shot and killed. All the squaws in that hole were afterwards killed &#8230;&#8221; [SH131]</div>

<h3 align="justify"> 20th Century Church Atrocities</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<div align="justify"><b>Catholic extermination camps</b><br />
Surprisingly few know that Nazi extermination camps in World War II were by no means the only ones in Europe at the time. In the years 1942-1943 also in Croatia existed numerous extermination camps, run by Catholic Ustasha under their dictator Ante Paveli, a practising Catholic and regular visitor to the then pope. There were even concentration camps exclusively for children!In these camps &#8211; the most notorious was Jasenovac, headed by a Franciscan friar &#8211; orthodox-Christian Serbians (and a substantial number of Jews) were murdered. Like the Nazis the Catholic Ustasha burned their victims in kilns, alive (the Nazis were decent enough to have their victims gassed first). But most of the victims were simply stabbed, slain or shot to death, the number of them being estimated between 300,000 and 600,000, in a rather tiny country. Many of the killers were Franciscan friars. The atrocities were appalling enough to induce bystanders of the Nazi &#8220;Sicherheitsdient der SS&#8221;, watching, to complain about them to Hitler (who did not listen). The pope knew about these events and did nothing to prevent them. [MV]</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align="justify"><b>Catholic terror in Vietnam</b><br />
In 1954 Vietnamese freedom fighters &#8211; the Viet Minh &#8211; had finally defeated the French colonial government in North Vietnam, which by then had been supported by U.S. funds amounting to more than $2 billion. Although the victorious assured religious freedom to all (most non-Buddhist Vietnamese were Catholics), due to huge anticommunist propaganda campaigns many Catholics fled to the South. With the help of Catholic lobbies in Washington and Cardinal Spellman, the Vatican&#8217;s spokesman in U.S. politics, who later on would call the U.S. forces in Vietnam &#8220;Soldiers of Christ&#8221;, a scheme was concocted to prevent democratic elections which could have brought the communist Viet Minh to power in the South as well, and the fanatic Catholic Ngo Dinh Diem was made president of South Vietnam. [MW16ff]Diem saw to it that U.S. aid, food, technical and general assistance was given to Catholics alone, Buddhist individuals and villages were ignored or had to pay for the food aids which were given to Catholics for free. The only religious denomination to be supported was Roman Catholicism.The Vietnamese McCarthyism turned even more vicious than its American counterpart. By 1956 Diem promulgated a presidential order which read:</div>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
<div align="justify">&#8220;Individuals considered dangerous to the national defence and common security may be confined by executive order, to a <b>concentration camp.</b>&#8220;</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote dir="ltr">
<p align="justify">Supposedly to fight communism, thousands of Buddhist protesters and monks were imprisoned in &#8220;detention camps.&#8221; Out of protest dozens of Buddhist teachers &#8211; male and female &#8211; and monks poured gasoline over themselves and burned themselves. (<i>Note that Buddhists burned themselves: in comparison Christians tend to burn others</i>). Meanwhile some of the prison camps, which in the meantime were filled with Protestant and even Catholic protesters as well, had turned into no-nonsense death camps. It is estimated that during this period of terror (1955-1960) at least 24,000 were wounded &#8211; mostly in street riots &#8211; 80,000 people were executed, 275,000 had been detained or tortured, and about 500,000 were sent to concentration or detention camps. [MW76-89].</p>
<p>To support this kind of government in the next decade thousands of American GIs lost their life&#8230;.</p></blockquote>
<ul dir="ltr">
<li>
<div align="justify"><b>Rwanda Massacres</b><br />
In 1994 in the small African country of Rwanda in just a few months several hundred thousand civilians were butchered, apparently a conflict of the Hutu and Tutsi ethnic groups.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote dir="ltr">
<p align="justify">For quite some time there were only rumours about Catholic clergy actively involved in the 1994 Rwanda massacres. Odd denials of involvement were printed in Catholic church journals, before even anybody had openly accused members of the church.</p>
<p align="justify">Then, 10/10/96, in the newscast of S2 Aktuell, Germany &#8211; a station not at all critical to Christianity &#8211; the following was stated:</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr">
<p align="justify">&#8220;Anglican as well as Catholic priests and nuns are suspect of having actively participated in murders. Especially the conduct of a certain Catholic priest has been occupying the public mind in Rwanda&#8217;s capital Kigali for months. He was minister of the church of the Holy Family and allegedly murdered Tutsis in the most brutal manner. He is reported to have accompanied marauding Hutu militia with a gun in his cowl. In fact there has been a bloody slaughter of Tutsis seeking shelter in his parish. Even two years after the massacres many Catholics refuse to set foot on the threshold of their church, because to them the participation of a certain part of the clergy in the slaughter is well established. There is almost no church in Rwanda that has not seen refugees &#8211; women, children, old &#8211; being brutally butchered facing the crucifix.</p>
<p>According to eyewitnesses clergymen gave away hiding Tutsis and turned them over to the machetes of the Hutu militia.</p>
<p align="justify">In connection with these events again and again two Benedictine nuns are mentioned, both of whom have fled into a Belgian monastery in the meantime to avoid prosecution. According to survivors one of them called the Hutu killers and led them to several thousand people who had sought shelter in her monastery. By force the doomed were driven out of the churchyard and were murdered in the presence of the nun right in front of the gate. The other one is also reported to have directly cooperated with the murderers of the Hutu militia. In her case again witnesses report that she watched the slaughtering of people in cold blood and without showing response. She is even accused of having procured some petrol used by the killers to set on fire and burn their victims alive&#8230;&#8221; [S2]</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Iraq/Afghanistan War</strong></p>
<p align="justify">Over 2 million Muslims lost their lives after George W. Bush and Britain&#8217;s Tony Blair invaded Iraq and Afghanistan in 2003. The resultant vacuum created by the toppling of Saddam Hussein was filled by ISIS who now occupy half of Syria and Iraq, an area as large as the country of Belgium.</p>

<p>Her name is Paige Spiranac, a 22-year-old who&#8217;s bringing golf to people who never even thought about it before.</p>
<p>&#8220;I watched her lining up the hole and she putts with a perfect rap. Her pre-shot routine was entirely entertaining, as she bent over here, looked over there, bent down a little more,&#8221; an excited man amongst the audience revealed.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a double-bogey or three undid this beauty as she trailed at the bottom of the field, but still there&#8217;s next year.</p>
<p>Sprinac has a long way to go until she gets to the level of Cristie Kerr and her trophy, but practice makes perfect as they say.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>The night of the election, there is a strange quiet on the streets and boulevards of America. People have voted and the election results will soon be in.</p>
<p>Families pack around their TVs munching away as the results slowly ebb in to news rooms. Trump got New York, Trump got Massachusetts, Trump got Minnesota, pretty much every state apart from California.</p>
<p>The final results reveal a Trump win that everyone saw coming.</p>
<p>That night, the National Guard are mobilised across the entire United States, every home, every dwelling is visited and those who are deemed as undesirables are led out into the streets and put into prison trucks.</p>
<p>Families are torn apart overnight, some taken away, some left behind. There are shootouts as some try to stay in their homes but are killed or injured in the fighting.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/National-Guard-take-civilians-FEMA.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16404" src="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/National-Guard-take-civilians-FEMA.jpg" alt="National Guard take civilians FEMA" width="360" height="238" /></a></p>
<p>The morning after, people wake up and wonder where everyone has gone?</p>
<p>&#8220;You seen Kamal? He was meant to go to come into work this morning?&#8221; Julia, his co-worker in an electronics company asks.</p>
<p>She will never see Kamal again and neither will any other person as he is now in a FEMA camp set for deportation or processing. There are millions of people in these camps all scared, clueless as to what is to become of them, all at the mercy of the cruel camp guards who taunt and beat them daily.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/New-York-National-Guard-e1449663397660.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16400" src="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/New-York-National-Guard-e1449663397660.png" alt="New-York-National-Guard" width="360" height="214" /></a></p>
<p>In the FEMA camps &#8216;processing&#8217; means you are processed for extermination. There are incinerators in each camp which can reduce human bodies to ashes in less than fifteen minutes. Many are processed within the first few weeks of the Trump presidency. The plumes of smoke rise across all American cities as the furnaces burn day and night to exterminate the Untermenschen.</p>
<p>All borders around the United States are closed and the army has been given the job of keeping each centimetre of the borders under watch.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Civilians-interned-in-FEMA-camps.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-16401" src="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Civilians-interned-in-FEMA-camps.jpg" alt="Civilians-interned-in-FEMA-camps" width="360" height="200" /></a></p>
<p>Most of Miami is now a ghost town as the millions of Hispanics are now in camps or have been shipped back to South America or Cuba.</p>
<p>Los Angeles&#8217; population has been reduced by 89% and the African Americans and Hispanics are all safely away from the white population.</p>
<p>On the fourth week of his presidency Trump decides the Middle East is a problem that can only be solved by nuclear means. An atomic bomb is dropped on Syria killing millions of people. The global community is outraged and the United Nations calls an emergency meeting where the U.S. is castigated for such irresponsible behaviour.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/nuclear-bomb-middle-east-syria-e1449663581684.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16405" src="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/nuclear-bomb-middle-east-syria-e1449663581684.jpeg" alt="nuclear bomb middle east - syria" width="360" height="220" /></a></p>
<p>Trump says: &#8220;I solved the Middle East problem in half an hour. What would have taken decades or never I solved, so suck my balls bitch!&#8221;</p>
<p>As the radiation plumes spread across Iraq, Iran, Turkey, Jordan and Israel, many who are not in shelters suffer from radiation poisoning and die slow painful deaths.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Russia and China have been standing by watching the Don nuke half the Middle East. They show their disapproval of Trump&#8217;s actions by cutting off all diplomatic ties with the U.S.</p>
<p>Has President Trump bitten off more than he can chew? He is irrational and surrounded by yes men who dare not say a word against his emotive outbursts and illogical un-diplomatic rhetoric.</p>
<p>The third month of the presidency is the penultimate one and Trump loses his cool with Putin who is setting up Arctic bases close to the U.S.</p>
<p>The president orders Putin to get out of the Arctic and take his Russian soldiers back to Russia. In true Putin style, he stands his ground, something that makes Trump blow another gasket because he is only used to getting what he wants immediately.</p>
<p>Who fired the first shot is not known, but the result was an exchange resulting in thousands of Russian soldiers dying in their now ruined Arctic bases.</p>
<p>Putin, angered by this aggressive stance by Trump pushes through Ukraine in one week, then takes Finland.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in Libya, where ISIS have regrouped, there is a major push into Morocco and Italy. It seems the nuclear bomb in Syria did little or nothing to thwart the group.</p>
<p>Trump wants Libya nuked but is told in no uncertain terms that this action would start World War III in nuclear terms.</p>
<p>Undeterred, Trump nukes central Libya killing over 5.8 million people.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/multiple-launch-nuclear.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16406" src="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/multiple-launch-nuclear.jpg" alt="multiple launch " width="360" height="240" /></a></p>
<p>On the 18th of February 2016, radar stations based in Europe detect multiple launches from Russia and China towards the United States.</p>
<p>Trump is woken up in the White house, he is told to get to Air Force One immediately to be taken to the special bunker.</p>
<p>NORAD tracks the ballistic missiles getting closer, Trump gives the order, and as the first mushroom clouds are seen towering over U.S. cities, Trump and his family have been successfully delivered to their bunker. Safe and sound.</p>

When I&#8217;m prez we&#8217;ll just give &#8217;em a pill, put them into a sleep &#8212; permanently!&#8221; Trump told another whooping audience whilst waving his arms around imitating a mentally handicapped person.</p>
<p>The crowd&#8217;s cheering rose to a crescendo as the Trump moved onto Muslims.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I see one, I get my bodyguard to shoot it. Hey, it&#8217;s that simple. I don&#8217;t care, woman, man, child, whatever. We need to kill &#8217;em all like we did to the Injuns.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for Chinese people, the Don suddenly squinted his eyes and started talking like Fu Manchu.</p>
<p>&#8220;Flied Lice? Numbah 22! Ching, chong, ching, chong! They good at maths though. Know about the numbahs! But they can&#8217;t drive for shit. When I&#8217;m prez, we&#8217;ll probably nuke China. I&#8217;ll just say oops my finger slipped, hit the red button.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trump&#8217;s vitriolic hatred did not end there though, he saved his worst for the last.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jeez, I hate Sp*cks worse than anything else. Greasers, comin&#8217; over here and their stank food makes you fart. The other night I ate a burrito, I was farting like a cowboy round the fire. They smell, they&#8217;re ugly and when I&#8217;m president I&#8217;m sending them all back to Mexico. Fuck &#8217;em! They ain&#8217;t done nothing for this country apart from stink the joint up!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;N*ggers are okay though, they got that musical thang going on. They&#8217;re a very musical people. One boy, he was shining my shoe the other day, you know spit shine, I gave him a fifty cent tip. Wow. He was so happy just for that. Not bad for a 65 year old negro. Sure they&#8217;re dumb as shit, but so are women. Never trust anything that bleeds once a month and still lives after that. I just use them, don&#8217;t get me wrong I cherish women, as long as they&#8217;re on their backs gettin&#8217; fucked!&#8221;</p>

<p>The British &#8216;government&#8217; therefore under the current EU regime is not a sovereign government and cannot make its own laws, it cannot therefore govern, and is merely a symbolic organisation of people with <strong>NO </strong>power to run their own affairs.</p>
<p>David Cameron is therefore <strong>NOT </strong>a prime minister and there are no members of parliament in the House of Commons, simply because they cannot exercise their own laws or directives.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>Bread and circuses, is that it? When times are shitty they give us Strictly or put some non-entities into a jungle or they bring out block head Cowell to exploit mentally ill teenagers who want to be the next big &#8216;<em>fing&#8217;</em>.</p>
<p>Why is it that whenever there&#8217;s some sort of war on in the Middle East or terror alerts, they put this mindless crap on TV? If you posit the argument that it is pure escapism, that is wrong, because escapism should be enjoyable and not torture.</p>
<p>How is this entertainment? Watching some narcissistic Strictly poseur prancing around a stage in a camp manner and enduring the indignity of being graded like some Crufts poodle? At what level of &#8216;entertainment&#8217; does one acquire a revolver from a dodgy bloke in a pub and put it against their own cranium.</p>
<p>But what else is there to watch on the telly these days? Switch the fucking channel and get a bunch of z-listers in a jungle being forced to eat spiders and shit into buckets. How low do the celebuturds want to go? It seems so low that all self respect, dignity or decorum are completely amiss.</p>
<p>Switch the channel and get X-factor or whatever it&#8217;s called. Simon Cowell comes on with his circus of inequity, the banal talentless pieces of detritus not fit for any purpose but a one way trip to a glue factory are judged by equally talentless money-grabbing suckers of <a href="http://&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/YzO_4IHPlFQ&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;" target="_blank">satan&#8217;s cock</a>.</p>
<p>This, ladies and gentleman is not entertainment, it is torture, it is crud of the highest order, puerile pestilence and you the audience lap it up because you have no idea about quality of entertainment. Is that it? Why on earth would an audience favour this shit, when it would be preferable to be tortured by a thousand cuts by some Chinese chap from the 19th century?</p>
<p>Conclusion: The audience is to blame purely on the basis that they watch this crap.</p>

<p>Billed as a stealth destroyer invisible to radar, the ship can be seen from miles away with a $2.99 pair of binoculars from Walmart.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can see this ship from space it stands out so much. Hell it has massive sheet metal sides easy for targeting. All you need is a few missiles slamming into the side and it&#8217;s toast,&#8221; a nervous Navy sailor said as he boarded the ship for the first time.</p>
<p>The Russians were asked to comment on the ship on Monday, but all that was heard were cackles of laughter and guffawing.</p>
<p>Priced at $4.4 billion it&#8217;s just another death trap piece of floating sardine can junk that would see the seabed as soon as a war broke out.</p>

<p>According to Russian sources, including the president&#8217;s personal chamber maid, he drinks a glass of polonium each morning with his breakfast.</p>
<p>&#8220;I deliver the glass to our Tsar in a lead lined box. He then drinks it down in one. Afterwards, I have to take the empty glass to a special area where it is sealed and disposed of with other nuclear waste,&#8221; Svetlana Babushka, told the Tass news agency.</p>
<p>Former FSB agent, Igor Rostov, revealed that over the years of poisoning his dissenters and rivals, Putin slowly grew immune to the effects, and many have tried to poison Putin to no avail.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were out in Siberia on a shooting trip when Putin pulled down his trousers and urinated in a lake. By sundown all the wildlife and fish had died and were floating on the lake,&#8221; the former friend of Putin, who is now dead, revealed before his death in August.</p>

<p>Has Putin bitten off more than he can chew? Here is a man who is Russia&#8217;s strong man and he is now bogged down in Syria. How long can he sustain the expensive bombing campaign before his accountant starts prodding him on the shoulder?</p>
<p>Why haven&#8217;t the Russians learnt from their mistakes in Afghanistan?</p>
<p>&#8220;Putin is someone who can&#8217;t walk away from anything, and once he is committed to something that&#8217;s it, there&#8217;s no going back,&#8221; a Moscow insider revealed.</p>
<p>The extent of <a href="http://isis.liveuamap.com/" target="_blank">territory</a> that needs to be bombed is vast, and even though there are many nations involved, Russia has taken the mantle as head bomber.</p>
<p>Russia&#8217;s economy will slump by almost 4 percent this year and barely grow in 2016, with forecasters expecting the country&#8217;s recession to persist as the engineered low oil prices hit on Russia&#8217;s main income.</p>
<p>Western sanctions have also hurt Russia&#8217;s economy which were put into place after Putin invaded and annexed Crimea.</p>
<p>Overall global commodity prices are seeing a major slump which invariably eats into Russia&#8217;s continued economic misery.</p>
<p>Bombs cost money, logistics to operate militarily cost billions and even though Putin has been bombing thousands of targets, there is no assurance that he is making any headway destroying ISIS or other rebels, who simply move to other areas when they hear the jets, or get intelligence of attacks prior to bombing campaigns.</p>
<p>The Americans have been very kind to ISIS by notifying them 45 minutes before they bomb so that people can get out of the way, the Russians probably do not offer the same sort of courtesy, but as mentioned before, hitting things from thousands of feet above the ground is no assurance of killing fighters on the ground. Sure, they may blow up a few shacks and sheds, but for that kind of money, it would be better to have troops on the ground to sweep the area afterwards taking out any stragglers and securing the territory once and for all.</p>
<p>At the moment the Russians are spending a measly <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2015/10/21/this-is-how-much-russias-war-in-syria-costs.html" target="_blank">$4 million</a> a day on Syria, but Putin has already spent over $180 million since the beginning of his campaign. This money will go down the drain as Putin bombs and bombs for many years to come, entrenched in an unwinnable conflict, draining Russia day by day.</p>
<p>Russia is economically weak, plodding along at a snail&#8217;s pace and destined to poverty, this is why the quicksand of Syria will invariably hasten Putin&#8217;s head strong demise. Alienating whole countries like Turkey will also not solve any problems for Russia.</p>
<p>Big mistake Mr. Putin. Has the grand master chess champion finally been checkmated?</p>

<p>&#8220;We did it to the Japs. We put them in concentration camps in World War II, so why not the Muslims?&#8221; Trump said at a recent rally in Missouri.</p>
<p>Currently there are over 3,000 mosques in America, and the number is growing daily, but under Trump things would change.</p>
<p>&#8220;Demolish them. Make them into parking lots, at least they&#8217;d serve a purpose then.&#8221;</p>

<p>And what about relations with Muslim countries like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan?</p>
<p>&#8220;We would sever ties with all these savage countries. Nothing but beasts roaming the prairie.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, there you have it folks, when Trump is elected it&#8217;s goodbye Muslims and hello Trump paradise.</p>

<p>&#8220;At least Jeremy Corbyn was voted in, that was not the case with Gordon Brown who shoehorned himself into the Labour leadership from Tony Blair without an internal election and was summarily voted out of office after his disastrous tenure as an unelected Prime Minister.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ed Miliband was a nightmare that never happened for British voters who thankfully saw through his façade on election day. Can you imagine five years under Miliband, Britain would be hell on earth?&#8221; a voter said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Corbyn, although portrayed as a loon by the media is actually forthright in his actions and speech, he has the demeanour of a man who just doesn&#8217;t give a shit, and really he doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>There is support for Jeremy Corbyn, simply because of the sheer number of disaffected, marginalised people there are in Britain today.</p>
<p>Labour really has a fighting chance in 2020 under Corbyn, as he exudes an inner strength that is unmatched by any other Labour candidate or for the most part any Tory on the current roster.</p>

<p>Odeon Cineworld and Vue chains, who control 80% of screens around the country, have refused to allow the Lord&#8217;s prayer to be aired as a sixty second advert because of a policy of not allowing political or religious advertising.</p>
<p>Dictating what can and can&#8217;t be broadcast, or message heard, is a crime in our view, and the Church has every right to be angry. We&#8217;re also with Dawkins on that one.</p>
<p>As a society, we should embrace freedom of expression in all its forms, even from those who we may staunchly disagree.</p>
<p>There should be civilised discussion of all subjects allowed in all forums of life, if not, then we ultimately depart from civility and enter a place of ignorance and dictatorship.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>The word assassin derives from the Arabic &#8216;<span class="foreign">hashishiyyin&#8217;. Hasan ibu-al-Sabbah was the leader of an extremist hashish munching Islamic sect during the period of the Christian crusades, whose penchant for calculated murder of opponents was unrivalled.</span></p>
<p>Within Europe today many potential assassins are within our midst, some who do their job cleanly, and others who complete their jobs in a messy fashion for maximum money shot effect, but either way, these people have triggers, and their controllers are able to switch them on and off at will.</p>
<p>Psychological alters are embedded deep within the mind, where they can outwardly exhibit completely different personalities, but they have many multiple alters within their honey comb minds, some parts not even aware that other parts exist.</p>
<p>The process of mind control usually starts from infancy, and religion is an excellent conduit although the best technique is trauma based. The Islamic religion is the most effective tool around today for perfect mind control, but Christians and other religious recipients are also very susceptible to mind control.</p>
<p>If you believe that Jesus walked on the water and his body floated up to heaven after he died, you have been brainwashed to some extent, and there are grown men and women around today who emphatically believe that Jesus was a supernatural being. These people still function in a seemingly normal manner in their jobs, their daily life yet were brainwashed from infancy to believe in something that is completely removed from reality, science, logic or physical possibility. Brainwashing is also generational, and is carried from the parents to the child.</p>
<p>There are thousands of innocent looking refugees walking into Europe right now, but to stigmatise those who are genuinely in need of help is wrong, unfortunately amongst the real refugees will be the alters. They will look as harmless and needy as the rest, they will have stories of horror, of hardship and war, but that will be their top visible layer, and not the multiple alters they hide so well. Only highly trained people or their specific controllers can detect the embedded parts of a functioning alter.</p>
<p>The process of training these people to be assassins and terrorists possibly takes years, and the mind control experts in charge know exactly how to manipulate their charges with intricate care.</p>
<p>There is an element of truth in mind control in popular fiction, for example in the Bourne Identity, there are prime examples of actual CIA processes utilised on agents, as well as Ian Fleming&#8217;s Bond character who does display many facets to his character of mind control.</p>
<p>Distinguishing the mind and the brain is of course an important factor in describing things, the brain is the property of the medical faculty and the mind is a concern of the psychoanalytical field, however when it comes to complete mind control, both elements are utilised to great effect sometimes with the use of drugs.</p>
<p>One can get Sirhan Sirhan, a loopy Palestinian immigrant to do things he never thought possible, especially when he has a complete blackout to the things he did afterwards, or how about getting some social misfit to go on a shooting spree, an excellent precept to calling for gun control. Get enough shooting sprees going, then everyone will be calling for it to stop.</p>
<p>Learning a linguistic set of words, your first spoken sentence, the process of learning is an indirect process of mind programming, because it establishes a given pattern that one must follow through symbols.</p>
<p>Fashion is a form of mind control, and people who follow fashion are dedicated to their narcissistic desire to follow others in the way they look. Followers of fashion think they are unique but this cannot be further from the sordid truth as they are really mindless followers.</p>
<p>What does a computer programmer do? First he has to be programmed himself, then once he has been programmed he can utilise his new found program to do some programming within the framework of the programming language.</p>
<p>Being in a football crowd at a game is a tribal form of mind control, even doing a Mexican wave at a game displays a certain hive like behaviour.</p>
<p>If you are reading this right now, or have come up to this point, well done. This article is not brainwashing you though, that is not the purpose of this article, but please email the editorial department detailing the bank transfer you are about to complete for as much as you can spare, let&#8217;s say a £1,000.

<p>Well, we feel there is no appreciation of quality any more on the internet, all advertisers are looking for is visits, they do not look at the quality, insightful nature of the content.</p>
<p>You can have a potato on a plate on YouTube getting 560 million visits and millions of subscribers, and they will have full appreciation from the advertisers and sponsors.</p>
<p>Quantity does not necessarily mean quality and satire is something that holds testament to that fact. By not being able to measure quality, the internet controllers like Google and key advertisers are overlooking the many sites who offer something new, refreshing and insightful, they are consigning whole swathes of innovators into the dust bin of inequity surpassed by banal plastic meaningless, art-less shit, not fit for purpose but as a twenty second flick by a surfer.</p>
<p>Our site has been punished by the un-mentionables ever since its inception and sabotaged on many occasions because of its content, but we survived that and are still recovering although daily more hurdles are thrown our way. C&#8217;est la vie.</p>
<p>As we mention on our Satire page up top, satire really is the last bastion of free speech and we intend to stick to our guns through all the bollards, walls, and other nonsense thrown in front of us.</p>
<p>By stifling satire, humanity as a whole suffers because the dissemination of real truth is thus stifled and the narrative is one of totalitarian dystopia and dictatorial conformity.</p>
<p>Ad-blocking has hurt publishers, in fact so much that many have gone under, however, we could take these ads off tomorrow and we would really love to but how the fuck would we pay for the beer?</p>
<p>The Daily Squib from now on will solely be producing cat videos with Justin Bieber soundtracks.</p>
<p>End of rant&#8230;</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>The sheer scale of bombing in Syria by the Russians is outstanding. Just in the last few days the Russian sorties have taken out thousands of Jihadist sites, and with talk of landing 150,000 troops to clean up the job, there is a moment of disturbing silence as the Americans can only sit back and watch.</p>
<p>We saw some chummy behaviour with Obama at the G20 and there were even murmurs of Putin coming in from the cold although the reality of the situation is far from any sign of reconciliation.</p>
<p>Putin has taken Syria, America has lost Syria, that is the bare bones truth of the matter. Of course, Assad will be allowed to stay but his debt to Putin is unpayable, he will forever be Putin&#8217;s subjugate.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ISLAMIC-STATE-TERRITORY.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-15880 size-large" src="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ISLAMIC-STATE-TERRITORY-1024x782.png" alt="ISLAMIC STATE TERRITORY" width="640" height="489" /></a></p>
<p>The Americans who had Syria and Iraq firmly in their sights are now effectively locked out. What are they going to do, time has already passed and their chance to take the prize left with the dinner money? Obama&#8217;s recalcitrant tone of not following advice from his generals and military advisers to invade the fucker and get it over with have left the United States standing on the sidelines, a missed opportunity that does not bode well in the long term for American hegemony in the region as well as globally.</p>
<p>Where does Britain fit in with all of this? Fuck knows, and that&#8217;s a quote from David Cameron, who probably doesn&#8217;t even know what a hellfire missile is.</p>
<p>To see the scale of the Russian incursion into Syria we refer you to an excellent interactive <a href="http://militarymaps.info/" target="_blank">map</a> of the current conflict.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s simplify this, finance house Edmond de Rothschild Group is threatening legal action against Rothschild and Co over the use of the Rothschild family name. Benjamin de Rothschild and Ariane de Rothschild who are higher up in the ranking than David de Rothschild do not want a name change of Paris-Orleans to Rothschild and Co. which, if one looks at it, seems to supersede the Edmond de Rothschild Group purely by utilising an all encompassing name.</p>
<p>One lawyer on the scene was quoted as saying: &#8220;Frankly I don&#8217;t give a damn, as long as they pay me, why should I give a shit. I&#8217;m rolling in it here. Wahoo!&#8221;</p>
<p>Christmas has obviously come early for some.</p>

<p>Panic broke out at this year&#8217;s Hajj pilgrimage in Mecca when one pilgrim thought he heard a drone flying above, then there was a lot of pointing and someone started to run. Within minutes the tarmac was a macabre jumble of dishevelled, partially clothed bodies as the stampede gathered pace away from the imaginary drone.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are used to seeing drones all over our countries bombing us indiscriminately, so naturally there was panic. In fact, in my village we only have one house left standing and no children left for the school, they were all bombed to death by U.S. drones,&#8221; Abdul Khaseem, a Muslim pilgrim who survived the stampede told Saudi news reporters on Thursday.</p>
<p>The United States defence secretary later denied there were any deadly drones in the area at the time, he said they&#8217;re too busy bombing schools and hospitals in the Middle East and there aren&#8217;t any spare ones to bomb the pilgrims available.</p>

We worship the same Lord.&#8221;</p>
<p>And thus to those words, there was a mischievous twinkle in Pope Francis&#8217; eyes, and Obama smiled smugly revealing his pointed incisors.</p>
<p>Indeed, the cover of aiding the populations actually hurts them, the trick of healing makes people sicker, and the ruse of freeing the population imprisons them further.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our poison is their medicine. We will behave as if we are not connected to keep the illusion alive. Our goal will be accomplished one drop at a time so as to never bring suspicion upon ourselves. This will also prevent them from seeing the changes as they occur. We will keep their lifespan short and their minds weak while pretending to do the opposite. We will use our knowledge of science and technology in subtle ways so they will never see what is happening. We will use soft metals, ageing accelerators and sedatives in food and water, also in the air. They will be blanketed by poisons everywhere they turn. We will promise to find a cure from our many fronts, yet we will feed them more poison. Drop by drop, drop by drop we will advance our goal. We will take over their land, resources and wealth to exercise total control over them. We will deceive them into accepting laws that will steal the little freedom they will have until they are totally and completely defeated,&#8221; a jovial Obama told the pope during a White House luncheon.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>&#8220;All civilisations transition, and the moment of change is always embellished with war, for the global good, there will have to be total and utter destruction, as history has always shown, great empires crumble, religions disappear, man-made gods are forgotten, cities are plundered, cathedrals are smashed into dust.</p>
<p>&#8220;From the ashes one can easily rebuild, but without war, integration is nigh on impossible, primarily because of the old world stifling the new world and restricting transition.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is to this end, that complete global warfare is the process of shifting civilisation from the defunct systems utilised in the past to the forward new order, a complete cleansing of elements not required any more.</p>
<p>&#8220;Diplomacy that brokers change is redundant as diplomacy only slows the process of inevitable metamorphosis. The global plan should not be stifled by diplomacy, all diplomats who work for the hierarchy know this anyway and will be ordered to stop, as their efforts hurt the multi-dimensional final push for world dominance by one single faction. War effects change faster and more efficiently than any so-called peace not only in policy but in technology.</p>
<p>&#8220;All things must change, and the world as it is now, is living beyond any coherent manageable state, the appointed leaders of nations know this and so does the hierarchy many levels above the visible controllers.</p>
<p>&#8220;We see the great technical minds building amazing machines, self-driving vehicles, nano technology, mechanical humanoids, but these creations cannot co-exist in a world where some humans still live in the dark ages.</p>
<p>&#8220;One cannot explain to the brainwashed religious zealot anything other than a language of all encompassing violent warfare, it is the humane thing to do, to simply put those people so caught up in their belief system out of their misery once and for all, to make them disappear completely, never to return. Once they have all been eradicated, the singular world religion will be introduced, the true global and universal purpose of unity.</p>
<p>&#8220;The technique of governance is a formidable tool, however it falls short when chaos ensues. Global population levels have increased to such numbers that global warfare is now inevitable simply because of finite resources being plundered and permanently depleted. Nations may think that printing perpetual amounts of currency in a world where resources are finite is sustainable, where populations especially in developing nations continue to grow is manageable. They are wrong, and they may hide behind the walls of the condemned future generations, but the inevitable must always reveal itself however much the leaders choose to ignore or delay the truth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Without war, the human race will not survive its next shift upwards.&#8221;</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>Imagine a country where there is one camera for eleven people, where your every movement is tracked, where your every conversation is recorded and where restrictions apply to how you live your life and every decision you wish to make is dictated to you.</p>
<p>East Germany, Soviet Russia, George Orwell&#8217;s 1984, Terry Gilliam&#8217;s Brazil &#8212; no &#8212; Britain 2015.</p>
<p>&#8220;The positive thing is that it will only get worse, every year they bring in more restrictions to human living. The super-state of the EU encompasses all and the UK is part of this behemoth amalgamated bureaucratic dictatorial state of permanent surveillance,&#8221; a person who dared to say anything said before being taken away in an unmarked van.</p>
<p>The beauty of the system is that the population pay to be imprisoned. Smart phones galore they queue for hours to buy devices that track their every movement and conversation. They download apps that specifically inspect their every movement and contact list. Social networking is the ideal place for the clueless lemmings to be spied on and not having a Facebook page is deemed a crime in itself by the brainwashed plebs worthy of nothing but contempt.</p>
<p>Consider liberty and you are labelled a trouble maker, marked for deletion, not only by the authorities but by the enslaved masses too happy to shop you in for spoiling their permanent state of entertainment. Freedom is a dream, a word in a dictionary that means nothing.</p>
<p>Pass the marmalade, which brand do you use, how do you apply it to the toast, yes my smart-toaster knows best as it relays the information on to whoever needs it. Ah, the smart-meter tells me I used up a little too much kilowattage last night, therefore it relays data to whomever it concerns on what appliances one uses in the household and how much allowance is permitted for the coming week.</p>
<p>And so we come to the cashless society, a place where if one disobeys or mentions discontent, they get electronically erased, no food, no water, no job. It certainly is a very hefty stick to wield by the almighty control system, a totalitarian tip toe here, an almighty step there.</p>
<p>How long before the microchipping begins? Will you be able to hold employment, buy food, get a hospital bed or go to school without one? Certainly not. Your number will be up, next on the line as another example to be made for your silence and inaction. Your digital prison awaits.</p>

<p>Friday night down in Newcastle, the scantily clad munters are out on force, and the blokes are raring to go in their white t-shirts and wild-eyed boozed up stares. The town centre&#8217;s bustling under the weight of religious lager fuelled sex, violence and drugs, and to add to the mix, a deadly strain of super gonorrhoea.</p>
<p>You may think it&#8217;s just another Friday night, but in the morning you wake up next to an old boiler, vomit into a half eaten doner kebab and make the long journey towards the toilet. This time, something&#8217;s wrong and you feel it in your nether regions, yes a burning sensation that you&#8217;ve never felt before except that one time you accidentally mixed up the vapo rub instead of the nivea and had a jostle before realising it was too late. Your meat pump seems like it&#8217;s on fire, you shout out in agony which invariably wakes up the girl who just gave you super gonorrhoea. Then, to top it off, instead of pee pee coming from your shogun&#8217;s eye, an eruption of different sorts shoots all over the toilet seat cover, it&#8217;s green slime, looking and smelling like something dredged up from the inside of a Chinese takeaway restaurant&#8217;s fridge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Something wrong luv?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We made a good trick. We&#8217;re going to take the money, then declare bankruptcy after the money is used up. The final fuck you,&#8221; a Greek Finance Ministry worker revealed on Friday.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s 350 Billion euros + 86 Billion euros? Yep, 436 Billion euros. That&#8217;s a lot of money that will never get paid back, and the Greeks are laughing all the way to the bank.</p>
<p>&#8220;This will be the final finger to Germany. If they and the Troika are stupid enough to give us another 86 Billion euros, then they deserve to get hit big time. They deserve this punishment, throwing money away like that into a Greek black hole, they might as well shred the money right now. Hah! Who in their right mind would lend any more money to some place like Greece? Even the Russians would not,&#8221; Costas Manana, a government worker told Greek newspapers.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>&#8220;Okay, the devil, or Satan, whatever you wish to call him has got a place down there where the bad people go after they croak. But check this out, if the devil is like really bad and some Joe goes down there who was bad in life, why&#8217;s he going to punish him? Hell, the devil&#8217;s just gonna say &#8216;well done you&#8217;re one of us now&#8217; he&#8217;ll tell &#8216;em to take a seat relax and have some more fun. Contrary to belief, the devil does not like to punish the bad ones, he has no reason to, and <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuureXcbddY" target="_blank">hell ain&#8217;t such a bad place to be</a>,&#8221; Francis told a shocked audience on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Without hell, there would not be a heaven, and vice versa, so what&#8217;s up in heaven for Christians?</p>
<p>&#8220;Heaven is boring. You&#8217;ll meet some old relatives up there, and everything is white. That&#8217;s it. You can&#8217;t get more boring than that plus there&#8217;s this awful elevator music on constant loop,&#8221; the pope added with a mischievous grin.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Other Religious Questions Answered </strong></span></p>
<p><strong>1) If the pope believes there is an afterlife and is fearless of death why does he go around with heavily armed guards and bulletproof vehicles?</strong></p>
<p>Because the truth is that the pope is seriously afraid of death and he knows when you die, once your brain stops working, that&#8217;s it. Nothingness.</p>
<p><strong>2) Why did the Christian church create a devil?</strong></p>
<p>So that it could scare the shit out of simple people into doing what they wanted them to do in the old days when many could not reason, read or write. Also, to create a duality, a bogey man. Without the devil, God would not have an adversary and look so good. One cannot exist without the other.</p>
<p><strong>3) How come the snake could speak in perfect English in the Garden of Eden?</strong></p>
<p>He was a talking snake dummy. Get with the program. Everything thousands of years ago spoke in perfect Medieval era English and Latin.</p>
<p><strong>4) If God is around all the time and all seeing, why did he not warn Adam and Eve about the talking snake, and maybe intervene?</strong></p>
<p>Sheesh. Even God takes a break some times. He must have been cutting his toe nails or something.</p>
<p><strong>5) If God created everything in the universe, does this mean he created the devil too?</strong></p>
<p>Yep, the devil is part of God&#8217;s creation, because he created everything in the universe. Therefore, the devil is part of God.</p>

<p>China currently has a population of 1,268,853,362 whilst India has 1,004,124,224 growing daily. These two nations are pumping out vast amounts of noxious, poisonous gases into the atmosphere, and contributing to pollution that defies measurement causing irreparable damage to the ozone and environment.</p>
<p>The term climate change is synonomous with over-population, they are one and the same. Overpopulation contributes to increases in carbon gases, pollution and destruction of the environment and finite resources.</p>
<p><strong>Malthusian Nightmare</strong></p>
<p>How do we tackle the problem of overpopulation?</p>
<p>The respective governments involved must increase the methods and technique of population control by speeding up sterilisation, abortion, euthanasia, contraception. Compulsory sterilisation is also an option if populations are not decreased sufficiently, and there are programs in India already enforcing this technique.</p>
<p>Every person in China and India wants a top-of-the-range SUV to drive. They want what they see in wealthy nations. They want to live the Western idealistic lifestyle.</p>
<p>The proliferation of war is another technique to reduce populations as well as instances of disease and viruses, whether man-made or natural. These techniques, however are intermittent and not consistent methods of population reduction.</p>
<p>Until the population of these polluting countries are decreased by large numbers, the planet and its resources are in danger, as is the rest of the responsible population of other nations.</p>
<p>For the planet to survive, these offending nations must implement an immediate ban on breeding, as strong as this may sound, if this is not implemented immediately, the rest of the earth&#8217;s environment has little or no chance of survival as pollution spreads through the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Chinese and Indian pollution encompasses the entire globe and is a direct threat to the environment and all life on planet earth.</p>

<p>He has uncontrollable urges to perform Hitler salutes approximately every thirty seconds, and has been banned from many places because of his terrible affliction.</p>
<p>The unemployed, and certainly unemployable man, has been diagnosed with Hitleritis, a rare medical condition that raises the right arm straight and salutes intermittently.</p>
<p>&#8220;I might be having a cup of tea with the vicar, reach for a scone, and there it goes. My arm salutes in a Nazi fashion and I yell out &#8216;Heil Hitler&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dRx4M_bg84Q" width="640" height="480" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>The worst incident occurred in January, when Barry was doing some shopping in Llandudno city centre. He was in Argos when a group of German exchange students walked in. The chaos that ensued resulted in Barry being forcibly ejected from the store and arrested for his Hitler salutes that accelerated in ferocity when he heard the exchange students talking amongst themselves.</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard them talking and it got worse. I started goose stepping and saluting at the same time whilst shouting Heil Hitler. Worst day of my life. They [the police] gave me an ASBO and I can&#8217;t go to the shops or anywhere for that matter any more. I am so depressed.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is help at hand though for Barry. A pioneering new treatment has been made available where the offending Hitler saluting arm is strapped to the body to stop it jerking up involuntarily. Although this helped Barry for all of five minutes, his body started to compensate by performing other Nazi traits like goose stepping, shouting Nazi slogans and ordering anyone in the vicinity into the showers.</p>
<p>If anyone has any ideas on how to cure Barry, please leave a comment below.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>The royal arrest decree by beheading was last used in the year 1747, on Scottish Jacobite, Simon Fraser, 11th Lord Lovat, and will be used on Rupert Murdoch for his part in exposing the Queen and royal family as playful Nazis through his newspaper, the Sun.</p>
<p>Buckingham palace sources have long awaited the day to see Murdoch&#8217;s spindly Australian convict spawn&#8217;s tortoise neck on the chopping block, and will be eager to entertain the crowds.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Sun newspaper has seen fit to print photos and films showing the youthful Queen and other members of the royal family doing some jokey Nazi salutes 70 years ago. Prince Philip, prince Harry and the rest of the Saxe-Coburg-Gotha clan, ahem Windsors, are outraged at such depictions, especially when some members of the royal family supported Britain so ferociously during World War II,&#8221; the BBC&#8217;s staunchly impartial royal correspondent, Richard Hangemhye, said during his weekly broadcast.</p>
<p><strong>What Will Happen</strong></p>
<p>Rupert Murdoch will be arrested tomorrow where he will be taken to the Tower. The Sun media mogul will then be executed by beheading.</p>
<p>On the day, the executioner will lead the prisoner to a raised platform covered with crumpled copies of the Sun newspaper on Tower Green where the assembled audience will be waiting.</p>
<p>Murdoch will be allowed a few last words, and a rabbi will give the prisoner the last rights before execution.</p>
<p>The executioner could take several blows before the head is finally severed. If the executioner&#8217;s axe is sharp and his aim is true, beheading is quick and relatively painless. If the instrument is blunt, the axeman inexperienced or careless, then the execution might take several strokes to sever the head. This was certainly the case in the execution by beheading of the brave Countess of Salisbury who was struck eleven times with the axe before she died in 1541.</p>
<p>After Murdoch is executed, his severed head will be held up by the hair. This is done, not as many people think to show the crowd the head, but in fact to show the head the faces of crowd and its own body. Killing by beheading is not immediate. Consciousness remains for at least eight seconds after beheading until lack of oxygen causes unconsciousness and eventually death.</p>
<p><em>The Murdoch execution extravaganza will be televised on July 24 exclusively on the BBC.</em></p>

<p>&#8220;There is a very simple answer. Religious people have mental triggers to perform atrocities, to kill, to maim, to murder en masse others who do not believe in what they believe.</p>
<p>&#8220;These triggers are embedded from generation to generation and are altars, embedded codes within religious texts read daily by followers of religion.</p>
<p>&#8220;A religion may seem peaceful within the text of a book, however the deeply embedded subconscious provocations are triggers that can go off like a bomb at any moment, especially if the religious person feels under threat in any way, or they perceive their religious indoctrination or belief system is under attack.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is thus natural for a religious person who believes in supernatural tales and myths of old lore to also suddenly pick up a weapon and start murdering, or even for a person in power who is a believer to rally the troops for &#8216;Holy&#8217; war.</p>
<p>&#8220;No person who utilises logic, reasoning skills or the ability to question should believe in religious fairy tales, and anyone who does believe in whichever book they were programmed to believe in should most certainly be viewed as a danger to all forms of rational sane thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;If there is to be any peace in the global arena in the future, there will first have to be a cleansing of religions. The only allegiance that will be allowed will be to the earth, nature, the universe, the one world government and knowledge expansion. Just as religion will be banned after the great purging, most certainly through cataclysmic religious wars, there will be a ban on nationalism, as this creates division and hatred as much as religion.</p>
<p>&#8220;The time is coming soon when the triggers will be enabled in the religious minds, simply because millions, billions of programmed people read the same books, and to their obedient controlled minds, they will follow the grim reaper to their deaths like unquestioning lemmings believing in whatever they believe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Give a religious person a choice, death at the end of a gun barrel or freedom, no doubt they will choose death if it means they will go to their respective programmed &#8216;heaven&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ballance has struggled throughout the opening two matches of the series and, at 1-1 with three Tests remaining, Bayliss has made the key decision to drop him for Bairstow, who has been in terrific form for Yorkshire. Ballance, who also plays his county cricket for Yorkshire, has struggled since May and has scored a half century in just one of his last 10 innings for England. In fact, throughout that <a href="http://www.espncricinfo.com/england/content/player/232438.html" target="_blank">period</a>  he has averaged just 17.5 runs per innings. That is a dreadful statistic for a top order batsman. It isn&#8217;t a huge surprise to see Ballance dropped from the side, especially as it appears the Australians have got used to his insistence on playing off the back foot.</p>
<p>Bairstow brings huge pedigree to the side and has experience of playing in some of the world&#8217;s biggest competitions. He was left out of the squad originally but has found his form at the crucial moment and is fully deserving of his spot in the team. Bayliss has acted quickly after England&#8217;s mammoth 405-run defeat last week and the Yorkshire star will have just over a week to prepare himself for the next Test match.</p>
<p><center><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/somethingness/9320676253/"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5334/9320676253_16b355a9c9_z.jpg" alt="Jonny Bairstow" width="640" height="361" /></a></p>
<p></center><br />
Bairstow has averaged 26.95 in his 24 innings in Test match cricket so far in his career, which includes four <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/aug/18/england-jonny-bairstow-lords-south-africa" target="_blank">half centuries</a> and a high score of 95. Although his Test match average is considerably lower than his other scores, the 25-year-old remains a talented batsman and is more than capable of racking up a huge score at the crease.</p>
<p>England will be hoping that he can replicate his county form but, despite Bairstow&#8217;s inclusion, the <a href="https://www.betfair.com/sport/cricket" target="_blank">hosts</a> are still priced at 3/1 with betfair to win the next Test and move 2-1 up in the five-match series.</p>
<p>England will find it difficult against a very good Australia side but can cause problems for the tourists, particularly if the Edgbaston ground staff produce a solid wicket as they did in Cardiff.</p>
<p>The likes of James Anderson and Mark Wood must up their game if they are to get at the Australian batsman, while Stuart Broad has been in great form throughout the opening two Tests. It will be tough but Bairstow is the type of player who can change a game and, along with fellow Yorkshireman Joe Root, could be the thorn in Australia&#8217;s side in the upcoming Test match.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m siding with the Iranians. I&#8217;m giving them time to create a functioning nuclear missile. There will be limited inspections at some sites, but we really won&#8217;t pry too much. It&#8217;s very secretive you know, they have some serious bunkers where they have all their stuff. Anyway, my Iranian friends have assured me they won&#8217;t drop the bomb yet, not until I&#8217;m out of office, then I&#8217;m gonna open up a can of Schlitz, sit back and enjoy the show on the networks,&#8221; Obama said, cackling like a rabid hyena in the White House&#8217;s rose garden, Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Iranians are very close to developing their first cruise missiles and are getting most of their nuclear technology from China, Pakistan and Russia.</p>

<p>David Cameron, the staunch europhile, is glad to hand over your hard-earned money and more to the EU, especially when it&#8217;s going to Greece, a black hole where cash goes and is never seen again.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/donkey_braying.mp3" target="_blank">Ass</a></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I am happy to give away your taxpayer money even though the UK is not in the eurozone. It is with great pleasure that I will oversee your money being dumped into Greece so that it is effectively shredded. We might as well just burn the cash. Our EU partners have ordered Britain to pay up on a third bail-out on the profligate Greeks so they can enjoy their gold-plated pensions and lazy lifestyles. Britain has no need for the money, the NHS and schools are all doing well, the roads are not full of pot holes, and we do not need the money for essential services like ambulances, welfare or the disabled,&#8221; Mr Cameron said with a big smile on his face on Wednesday.</p>

<p><strong>W A K E    U P</strong></p>
<p>This is real, this is no joke, this is not satire, this is as real as we have ever got. The EU referendum is the last chance the British people will have to keep their island. Please understand the gravity of the situation here, the economy will not suffer if we are out of the EU, it will soar. The UK will be a global trading partner and not stuck in some measly corner.</p>
<p>Here at the Daily Squib, we feel David Cameron&#8217;s pain, because he has been told that economically the UK will be better off stuck in the EU bloc, but he knows deep in his heart that what he is doing is wrong. Here is a man, a Prime Minister torn between selling off Britain on the cheap, surrendering to the EU when he should be freeing us from the chains and constant Schengen immigrant attacks. We know what is truly in your heart David and we urge you to go towards the light, because becoming a traitor to your people was never in your remit. The pompous gorillas strutting around Brussels are not Britain&#8217;s friend and you know that.</p>
<p>Okay, some parts of Europe are nice, but so what? Being out of the EU will not stop you travelling, you will have a British passport and that is still a ticket to pretty much anywhere.</p>
<p>Do you want hospitals, do you want schools, do you want to drive through roads again, do you want more money in your pocket?</p>
<p>Think about it, less money spent on EU benefits will mean exactly that. They are ruining Britain from the inside, they are taking away resources, they are causing massive crime waves, throw away the ghettos, deport the ones who are no use, get this island back to what it used to be, not some dumping area for the world&#8217;s poor, uneducated freeloaders. Britain should be inviting educated, intelligent people who will be of use, instead the clever ones are leaving these shores as they see what is happening. We need Brain Gain not Brain Drain as is the case right now.</p>
<p>Britain is being swamped and someone has to do something about it. That someone is you, and your chance to vote will be what makes this country Great again, not some insignificant zone floundering in a sea of mediocrity within the eurozone.</p>
<p>Break the chains holding Britain, stamp on the hands dragging us into the sea, stand up and fight for your country.</p>
<p>Please spread this article far and wide, read the Daily Squib from now on, we tell it as it is, we are not bullshitting here. This is Britain&#8217;s last chance. Open your eyes. See what is happening and know that you can change the future.</p>

<p>Created by 21-year-old Hong Hung Hi. Unter is based in Palo Alto, United States and is now worth over $650 billion.</p>
<p>&#8220;The concept is real simple. Where Uber means cars, Unter means drivers can use anything to transport their passengers. You got a go-cart, shopping trolley nicked from Morrisons, an old mule, or just a piece of rope, your customers get to their destination and everyone&#8217;s happy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite the words of encouragement from the company&#8217;s founder, Unter has come under fire recently from Londoners and taxi firms that use motor vehicles to transport their passengers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was driving down Shaftesbury when in front of me were 260 Unter taxis. Some were in trolleys. there was a tramp dragging a passenger in a cardboard box and even a camel. When the lights turned green, it took three hours to clear the junction,&#8221; Ron Melchard, a London cabbie told the BBC.</p>
<p>Unter customers are however delighted with the app and it has got rave reviews on the site.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where can you get a ride from Highgate to Whitehall for 23 pence? I thoroughly enjoyed my ride on an old dusty carpet smeared with cat poo and dragged along by my Unter driver. It took four days for the journey but my cab costs have gone right down.&#8221;</p>

<p>Enter Christian Democrat MP <a href="http://www.channel4.com/news/british-eu-exit-would-send-disastrous-message-to-world" target="_blank">Dr Norbert Röttgen</a>, a chief commissar of Comrade Merkel, and her fiendish plot to unseat the EU referendum.</p>
<p>He thinks he speaks for Russian pariah president Vladimir Putin, and says Uncle Vlad wants a Brexit.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we have here is a classic case of fearmongering propaganda which will invariably be pumped into households day and night right up to the referendum. It will seep into your very soul, and under the carpets, you will think Russians are behind the curtains waiting to pounce and the spectre of T-90 tanks rumbling down Trafalgar Square will haunt your every waking moment. The truth is, if Putin wanted to take Britain he would take it irrespective of it being in the EU or not. He would first cut through Europe like a knife through butter and the decommissioned British army would of course fight to the end outnumbered Zulu-like on this embattled island. Whether Britain joins the EU or not is of no consequence, what shall be done, shall be done, and Putin is simply being used here by their historic German foes as a focus point to scare the living shit out of you,&#8221; Professor of Propaganda Studies at Ruislip University revealed today.</p>
<p>The truth is, without the shackles of the EU holding Britain back, it would soar to be a global power, not only economically but militarily.</p>
<p><strong>TIPS TO BYPASS PRO-EU PROPAGANDA</strong></p>
<p>1) Switch off the telly as soon as it comes on</p>
<p>2) Look briefly if caught out, but then use factual reasoning powers and logic to see the nonsense of the propaganda</p>
<p>3) Always look at alternative sources (Daily Squib comes to mind)</p>
<p>4) Remember the people that died for Britain, remember their sacrifice, remember that surrender is not what made Britain. Winston Churchill wanted a united europe but not a Stasi totalitarian Soviet dictatorship</p>
<p>5) Look at the streets right now, and multiply by a thousand the number of foreign people there, because if Britain surrenders, you will eventually be turfed out of your own home and country by economic invaders and lose everything</p>
<p>6) Bookmark <a href="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk" target="_blank">this site</a> right now and spread far and wide</p>

I stuff the whole pita in his mouth and he chokes (making choking sound) then I say you like your meal? Do you like this nice Greek food? I give it to you my friend!&#8221; a visibly shaken Tsipras recalled on Euronews TV channel, after the umpteenth eurozone meeting this week.</p>
<p>The Germans did not take kindly to the culinary intervention and quickly ushered the Greek PM out of the room while Wolfgang Schäuble recovered from the kebab assault.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, back in Greece, ministers were unrepentant about the incident.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we lose this free money we always get, we are going to have to work and pay tax. That is unthinkable for Greeks. We just want subsidies, free money and a good time by the beach. Tsipras was just showing the goodwill of the Greek people,&#8221; Latsos Manaka, a Finance Ministry spokesman told newspapers on Wednesday.</p>

<p>&#8220;You ever get a pimple on the end of your nose? First it&#8217;s angry and red, painful to the touch, you nurture that thing with love and care, squeeze it once in awhile to test its contents. Once matured, it fills up nice and good, you can even see a little white head straining from the top. This time when you squeeze, you get payback as that balloon pops satisfyingly all over the mirror, well, that pimple is exactly like the economy, and when it bursts it will actually be a relief,&#8221; Fed Chairman, Janet Yellen told Congress on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Imgbo Wakusi, 28, a convicted murderer and cannibal, was anxious about the travel chaos at the French port: &#8220;I checked the news. I had already got the caravan ready, tires pumped and the oil topped up. It&#8217;s pretty scary that all this sort of thing is going on. Can&#8217;t these people act like civilised human beings? I&#8217;ve got a good mind to write to my local MP.&#8221;</p>
<p>The French government was unapologetic about the travel chaos created by British people travelling on their holidays and blamed the UK government.</p>
<p>&#8220;Naturally, it is the Ros Beef fault. They&#8217;re not allowing millions of people from the Third World to travel freely into their stupid little island. We are going to great lengths to open the borders for the African travellers to go to Britain, but no, the English swine stop us doing our job,&#8221; Pierre Dumerde, a senior official at the Calais port revealed.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>&#8220;Not only are the Western powers aligned with the Kurds but they seem to be conducting a proxy war against Turkey, who as a regional power holds NATO&#8217;s second largest army.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why would there be internal friction within NATO members complementing the destabilisation of the Middle East?</p>
<p>&#8220;The current conflict tainting much of the Arab lands is a war between Sunni and Shia, the former being the orthodox interpretation of Islam, and the latter being a sect of Islam, seen by many within the religion as a false interpretation and blasphemous to the original writings of Muhammed.</p>
<p>&#8220;The estimates of the number of Shia range from 120 to 170 million, roughly one-tenth of all Muslims.</p>
<p>&#8220;Therefore, the current war still in progress, could last for many years to come. What some in the West do not understand is that groups like ISIS are the core of Islam itself, and they strictly uphold the original orthodox teachings of the Muslim prophet, therefore their belief system is one that insists they are the correct path.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whoever is controlling groups like ISIS is not yet known, but one can have an idea from watching who they attack and who they leave alone (naming no names).</p>
<p>&#8220;President Obama has very kindly dropped off millions of pieces of military US-made weaponry to the area, almost like a pick&#8217;n&#8217;mix so that whichever faction gains ground gets the spoils.</p>
<p>&#8220;By arming Kurdish terror groups, the PKK and YPG, and giving them air support, Obama has estranged a key ally, Turkey, who have been constantly attacked by Kurds for over 50 years. The indemnity that is felt therefore is not lost, when during the Sunni, Shia war, a key ally of the West and NATO member moves away from Europe and looks further East.</p>
<p>&#8220;Turkey has lost all aspiration of being accepted in the EU, simply because they would never be let in to the bloc anyway as the demarcation lines are still firmly placed between religions. Although Turkey used to hold secular ideologies, those have been left much in the dirt as its abandonment from the EU accelerated.</p>
<p>&#8220;The numerous atrocities committed in the war zones, are all there to see through internet propaganda videos, and have zealously been covered in the Western media networks, not only as a form of entertainment but as a fear inducing mechanism.</p>
<p>&#8220;When someone like David Cameron, the prime minister of Britain says that all Muslims should loudly condemn the groups fighting in the Middle East, he speaks with tongue in cheek as he fully knows that the West is fuelling the conflict itself.</p>
<p>&#8220;The current underdogs are ISIS, although for the West, to see Muslims killing other Muslims in sectarian wars is an aphrodisiac, as the hatred for them is so strong.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not only the West who is deeply embedded within the Middle East but Russia, as the red line goes through Damascus and Tehran, the Russians are with the Shia, and in geopolitical terms, this is simply another front, as is the Ukraine.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now that ISIS moves towards Libya and Yemen, and onto Africa, they spread their ideology and stalwart military resilience away from the previous focus points to other regions, causing more fear and damage but gaining supporters along the way. Luckily for them, the path was cleared by the West through regime change in Libya, Yemen, Iraq and currently under way in Syria, the final goal being Iran.</p>
<p>&#8220;The second Gulf War directed by George W. Bush and his henchmen, was key in creating the vacuum for ISIS to be built, because it was a deposition of a secular Sunni leader and instatement of a Shia controlled government. This in turn created anger amongst the majority Sunni tribes who are now fighting to restore their place in the region. George W. Bush&#8217;s actions created an engineered void encouraging resentment as Sunni Iraqis were discriminated against or hunted down and killed. The president&#8217;s actions however were well calculated, as his military advisers knew that the newly instated Vichy government would foment the beginnings of the Third World War.</p>
<p>&#8220;The current U.S. president&#8217;s job has been rather simple, and that is to hold back. Like a rubber band being pulled further, public opinion will eventually snap and come around to boots on the ground again. The next president of the United States already knows the brief, and that&#8217;s to clean up the pawns of war as their usefulness is not needed any more. Those who were seen to being helped previously will be decimated and turned on as much as the overt enemy. Divide and conquer, a simple strategy perfected over thousands of years but a technique that needs much planning beforehand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This can has been kicked so far down the road that it&#8217;s barely <em>kickable</em>,&#8221; an economic analyst in Brussels revealed today.</p>
<p>Another analyst said: &#8220;The EU is going to throw away another 18 Billion euros into a black hole. It must really hurt now to be a eurozone taxpayer, imagine busting your behind, working long hours fully knowing well that the majority of your money is going to Greece, that must be really painful. I&#8217;d rather be unemployed.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Bent over the table</strong></p>
<p>In Greece, there were cheers of delight as the Greeks celebrated the news that Merkel had backed down.</p>
<p>&#8220;Back to the villa, we drink ouzo and party. Just another day in Greece. Let the Northern Europeans work, while we play and spend their money. This is beautiful, Merkel has no malakas, just like when she told Putin to stop fighting in Ukraine, and he simply continued pouring more troops in there.

<p>She added: &#8220;I&#8217;m here today because I live in a £2.5 million mansion and these people do not, but I want to be seen to care plus it boosts my celebrity status. Since I stopped singing I been out of the limelight for awhile.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ms. Church then applied a hefty kick with her boot on a crusty holding a banner telling him to &#8220;get out of the fucking way you unwashed smellbucket!&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Anti austerity publicity</strong></p>
<p>Also at the march was former comedian Russell Brand, who has now taken on the mantle of speaker for the people and part time &#8216;revolutionary messiah&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Austerity&#8217;s been good for me. My offshore accountant told me the other day that I&#8217;d made another packet, what was it, 650k, I said it&#8217;s good that it&#8217;s offshore then, innit? Just add it up with the rest of the wonga. I see the poor people here, and it&#8217;s a paradigm shift in my attitude, because at heart I&#8217;m poor, but my bank manager bloody well loves me. My raison d&#8217;etre is to speak for the people, and get them to buy my bookie wookies with their hard earned benefits. It&#8217;s like a paradigm shift from the taxpayer to my banky accounty so I don&#8217;t want that IDS chap ruining my living by fleecing the poor of my money.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hail the cause..</p>

<p>There is no need for political or economic analysis, long winded paragraphs of bull shit of the highest order, or fancy diagrams describing the out of control situation of Greece not paying the IMF.</p>
<p>The fact that Greece under Syriza&#8217;s leftist government can be summed up with one video clip from YouTube is an exercise in efficiency and technique much lacking by the bamboozled politicians and technocrats banging their clenched fists upon table tops in Brussels and New York.</p>
<p>Et voila, a clip from the 1994 film Dumb and Dumber. Enjoy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had this irresistible urge to write about how I felt that very second like I had done for a million other tweets I had committed to the <em>twittersphere</em>. Instead I held back. My hands were shaking. What would my fan base think of me? Beads of sweat dripped down my forehead as I pulled away. I then had another thought, and  another, these passed in my mind and missed the keyboard too. For a second I thought I was losing it, I was losing the will to live as my life passed away through my tweet time line,&#8221; Gobblestein recalled in an LA Times exclusive.</p>
<p><strong>Twitter Twatter</strong></p>
<p>Liberation for those few moments of tweet lapse did not come <em>cheep</em> though, because within those few minutes she lost over 40,000 fans.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone knows every minute detail of my life and thought process. All it took was a few minutes of tweet absence and boom, the whole thing blew up on me. I am now tweeting every few seconds to make up for the loss, and it will take me up until next Tuesday to make up for my twitter tweet lapse,&#8221; Gobblestein added.</p>

<p>When the boy refused requests to stop eating the biscuits he was first tasered continuously by 17 officers for approximately twenty minutes. The tasering had minimal effect on Johnsons so officers started unloading live ammunition into the victim&#8217;s pulsating corpse for nearly two hours solid.</p>
<p>&#8220;First we started on his back for one hour, then on the one hour twenty mark we had a lil donut break. Sarge went back to his cruiser and got us some more ammo and shotguns. We resumed shooting what was left of the body, and by the end we were shootin&#8217; scraps of meat across the car park.&#8221;</p>
<p>The officers were commended for their bravery in the line of duty, especially as the young man was deaf, dumb and blind and could have caused serious damage to no one in particular. No further investigation is going to take place because the boy was not black but of South East Asian heritage.</p>

<p>The film was released this week all over the Greek nation but no one had enough money to buy a ticket to see it.</p>
<p>Instead, it has been viewed across the rest of the EU as a cautionary tale about getting rear ended by a team of crazed leftist politicians gambling away the lives and fortunes of the Greek population for some naive utopian socialist paradise that will never materialise.</p>
<p>&#8220;I came away from the theatre with a tear in my eye. The film is about a crazy bald Marxist economist from Greece trying to give some Greek lovin&#8217; to a German guy in a wheelchair. It just was never meant to be,&#8221; Elena Schwaubles, from Vienna, Austria told Euronews.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, each episode of the Top Gear franchise will be hosted by a different celebrity, much like the insipid fall from satirical grace that befell Have I Got News For You, where every week they have been hosting some heavily scripted celebrity bottom sniffer to cajole the egos of the Mertons and Hislops,&#8221; a BBC executive revealed today from his London to Manchester black cab taxi ride.</p>
<p>Having a multi-celebrity cushion for these long-standing franchises is also a form of appeasement for the BBC, where they attempt to escape any form of blame from the audience.</p>
<p>The offering of a million quid per year for the hamster and May to stay is still in the works, and it is not known whether they will refuse the bait, or whether they will be tempted by aunty&#8217;s fishy knicker smell wafting through the putrid BBC air like a pungent thick soup of festering carrion.</p>
<p>Yet another reason to not pay the BBC poll tax, amongst many.</p>

<p>&#8220;Military spending is crucial to Britain&#8217;s security and standing in world affairs, especially in times of war. The world is in the beginning stages of complete global conflict, so why is George Osborne cutting military spending? Well, he already knows the result of the EU referendum, so he is acting in conjunction with the proposed EU army, which will be separate yet integrated loosely with NATO. There will only be a limited need for a dedicated British team, but when the EU military draft is announced, Brussels will dictate what Britain does in the coming conflict.</p>
<p>&#8220;The EU president, Jean Claude Juncker, has called for a dedicated <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-31796337" target="_blank">EU military force</a> as a matter of immediate urgency and plans are afoot to include all member states.</p>
<p>&#8220;The West&#8217;s oil supply lines are already being compromised in the Middle East, as 60% of the globe&#8217;s oil reserves lie, and ISIS extends its reach from Syria, through Iraq and into Libya. The ISIS threat has already been spoken of by <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/energy/oilandgas/11638709/Opec-under-siege-as-Isil-threatens-worlds-oil-lifeline.html" target="_blank">OPEC</a>, especially after recent attacks inside Saudi Arabia. Yemen has already fallen. Iran is embroiled heavily within the region as the Shiite Vs Sunni wars rage.</p>
<p>&#8220;From <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/01/world/africa/western-officials-alarmed-as-islamic-state-expands-territory-in-libya.html?_r=0" target="_blank">Libya</a> to Southern Italy is only a short boat ride, and if the conflict spreads to that region, the rest of Europe will be within reach of ISIS. The suicidal EU Schengen policy of open borders will be an open door for ISIS or any other military force cutting through Spain, then onto France and Portugal like a knife through warm butter.</p>
<p>&#8220;On the Eastern front, <a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/russia-can-occupy-baltics-in-2-days-2015-5?r=US" target="_blank">Russia</a> is daily moving troops and military hardware within striking distance of former Soviet bloc nations that are now part of the EU. If Vladimir Putin sees fit to attack, there will be no stopping him as the EU and NATO are too slow to act.</p>
<p>&#8220;China is moving military hardware and personnel onto disputed islands in the <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/c5e1443a-0773-11e5-a58f-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3bnVoSg9c" target="_blank">South China Sea</a> and increasing their base presence in the region controlling the area. China and Japan, who are long time adversaries are readying themselves for another conflict, which would naturally be of grave concern to the United States and EU.</p>
<p>&#8220;To therefore cut Britain&#8217;s defence budget now would be construed as madness by any sane strategist, especially under the current climate of war, however the modus operandi of George Osborne is to amalgamate Britain&#8217;s remaining forces with that of the forming EU army.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be naive to think that Britain would ever leave the EU, especially when the corporations dictate government policy. By giving a referendum to the plebiscite, the government is not risking much, because it knows that the votes are already cast, by the entities that really count, as George Osborne has already signalled with his massive defence cuts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The old generations are dying off, and this breath of fresh air is the spice of the new world that brings life from death.</p>
<p>&#8220;From the old comes only racism, nationalism, hatred, religion, division and past outdated morals that are no longer functional in the new world.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is to say, the old ideals and beliefs, the controlled divisive infernal religions and dogma are now irrelevant, the economic systems are redundant and the outdated political ideologies created in bygone eras are now completely defunct.</p>
<p>&#8220;The old era will be given the fast lane to death in the new world, because of the misguided nature they adhere to. What they have taken selfishly for themselves is not theirs to take, and the new shall inherit what the old cannot take to their graves.</p>
<p>&#8220;The hospitals with the creaking longevity riven elderly are tombs, burdens on society, and it is time to focus on the new age, to fast track the redundancy of the ageing populations that create massive economic encumbrance and inequality.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must build a bridge from the decrepit to the green pastures of the new epoch. The ones who have surpassed above politics and wealth are unencumbered by the past follies, fluid like water and adjustable to the new.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those who cannot adjust are contemptible in the eyes of the new age, and the<a href="https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/topics/sustainabledevelopmentgoals" target="_blank"> sustainable development goals</a> are an assurance to a future where the mistakes of the past are never repeated ever again.</p>
<p>&#8220;The technique of population transition is a process of change that must be adhered to with utmost diligence and necessity.&#8221;</p>

We knew that he would be elected but we also knew that this man from nowhere would also be the scapegoat, the tricked fool and the ultimate fall guy, not only because he was black, but because his masters controlled him so well.</p>
<p>America today is a mess, a country in deep distress, with debts racked up on bogus stimulus initiatives, leftist vanity projects that serve no purpose, and a population so deeply divided that the atmosphere resembles the months leading up to the American civil war, there will be no immediate cure for this sick patient as it has suffered indignity after indignity at every turn under the last two presidents.</p>
<p>The realised deficit is now at $21 Trillion, the unrealised tax liabilities are at $125 Trillion. The money printing buffer zone is gone, and unless the U.S. starts printing more fake money soon, people will tear each other apart in the streets when they realise the gravity of the situation they and the country are in. The rows and rows of soulless McMansions will be literal prisons for their residents, barricaded in, keeping away the angry mobs and torch bearing disenchanted.</p>
<p>&#8220;The people are mostly asleep, they may get little inklings here or there that something is wrong, but they will put that back and get on with their daily useless lives. This why the NSA have been so desperate to tap into the mind of the people by logging their every conversation, they want to know if people have woken up to what is happening, luckily the population is still unaware and still drunk on their soma for the masses fed to them daily,&#8221; a Capitol Hill source revealed on Wednesday.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KXIiaCAzeaI" width="640" height="480" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Socialism kills economies, and Barack Obama has done a beautiful job of bringing America to its knees, the blind leftists too drunk on their Soviet rhetoric and brainwashing via their daily twitter fixes of outrage and PC centric mind control may think they are clever but they are sheep being led to the slaughter, and anyone who voted for Barack Obama TWICE, should hold their heads in abject shame and remorse, but they won&#8217;t, because they are too unintelligent and deluded to realise their folly.</p>
<p>What happens in the U.S. will invariably affect the U.K.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter though, eventually, some time soon, the walls will be breached, as in all movements and mass popular action, once a few people wake up, they are like beacons, and the wildfire spreads culminating in an ultimate life changing form of realisation. They&#8217;re waiting for you though, and they know who you are now.</p>

The Greeks with their many threats and acts of blackmail are a sign that there is no love between the EU and Greece, however the threat of turning towards Russia is of great concern to NATO and the European Union.</p>
<p>&#8220;Already the Greeks are allowing Russian warships to dock in <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-31632259" target="_blank">Southern Cyprus</a>, and there are further threats to open up ports in mainland Greece.</p>
<p>&#8220;Talk of war is rife amongst the heavily indebted Greeks who possibly plan on utilising the Russians to <a href="http://en.enikos.gr/society/26144,Greek-Special-Forces-slogans-chanted-during-parade-prompt-backlash.html" target="_blank">invade Turkey</a>, which as a NATO ally is still reviled by the Greeks. This action alone would cause a dilemma for NATO as would involve two NATO members embroiled in a military conflict, with one backed by Russia.</p>
<p>&#8220;The geopolitical threat to the Mediterranean region could be insurmountable if the Russians gain warm water ports and as much as the traitorous Greeks ally with Putin, war within the Balkans could easily spread towards other European nations.&#8221;</p>

<p>The pilot of the BA plane, Captain Andrew Pelmarsten, addressed the passengers telling them that there was nothing to worry about, the Pope enjoys flying on his magic carpet and is a regular sight. Air traffic control was naturally notified prior to the flyby incident.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pastors across the country are getting ready to tell their flocks to hand their guns in to be scrapped. Americans are devoutly Christian, some even creating their own bastardised versions of Christianity like Mormonism, but the real clincher is that religion is a human construct and will be used to achieve goals set by the state for whatever agenda is required.</p>
<p>&#8220;They won&#8217;t listen to Obama or anyone else but they&#8217;ll listen to their pastor when he tells the congregation to hand over their guns. For Americans, their church leaders telling them to do stuff is an act of God such is the level of religious brainwashing over the generations.</p>
<p><strong>Submit</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;The same technique will be utilised when the government introduces microchipping to the population. By using what the pliant masses are used to to make people accept new conditions, the church is an invaluable tool for introduction to governmental directives.</p>
<p>&#8220;Religion spurs the American population on, especially in times of war where they are told they are fighting for Christianity when going into battle. Their unquestioning beliefs are paramount to implementation of the gun control agenda and should be exploited to the full.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Christian church cannot exist without the state, it is therefore deemed an arm of the state, and it is to this end that it will be used to disarm American citizens and eventually get them chipped, for their own good of course and in the service of the Lord.&#8221;</p>

<p>Styling themselves as the &#8216;next big thing&#8217; the people even went as far as to call themselves &#8216;artists&#8217; but anyone with any form of logic or reality would know better.</p>
<p><strong>Exploit</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Our logo is an inverted triangle if you connect the outer edges. This is trying to denote that we are not the usual bottom to top triangle as is usually the case but otherwise. In reality we ourselves are corporate whores who have watched our masters and want to emulate them by becoming corporate arseholes ourselves. This new music service will trick consumers into paying for more banal corporate material in the guise of being from the &#8216;artist&#8217; which we certainly are not. That&#8217;s why you, a sucker who is into autotuned template RnB shite and sub standard pap can pay us £20 a month. Alternatively, you can just buy a subscription for one month, record all the music you can through audio capture or download everything for free off the internet. Hey, we need to keep our mansions going, somebody gotta pay,&#8221; corporate rapper, Jay Z told his audience at the launch.</p>
<p>In other news, real artists are staying away and letting these loons make fools of themselves.</p>

<p>Sir Roger Moore, the quintessential Englishman, is of a <a href="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/7771-think-tank-core-britain-race-concentric.html" target="_blank">dying breed</a> that is being stamped out in a silent death march to oblivion and although there are minor squeaks of discontent here or there, the stiff upper lipped silence is deafening.</p>
<p>&#8220;Real <a href="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/9695-national-experts-ashamed-english.html" target="_blank">English</a> people, you know those who have ancestors going back thousands of years, are retreating, in a silent manner, away from the cataclysmic influx. They rarely mingle with the migrants, due to fear, disdain and their desire to stay amongst their own. The same applies to employment in businesses and companies, where the &#8216;English English&#8217; have their CVs looked at whilst the rest are put in the bin, something that is kept very quiet and never mentioned. There is a quiet code no one talks about, it&#8217;s not in the main stream media, or the BBC, where token migrants are paraded around to read news stories, the quiet code states that the core English community is very far apart from the rest, and it does not need to be class distinctive either, the English working classes have had to deal with the brunt of the influx, but they have kept their distance from the migrants. The Upper and Middle classes have been somewhat cushioned but are seeing the changes to their country every day, and they do not like it,&#8221; an Englishman said anonymously from his besieged castle outside the capital.</p>
<p>There is a sadness that the country which they have known and fought for for thousands of years is no more. What can the embattled English do?</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>You know, maybe we here at the Squib need to re-evaluate our relationship with the EU, but it is oh so confusing.</p>
<p>On the one hand the EU is a sort of quasi-sovietised entity that dictates weird directives towards its citizens and member states but on the other side, they do speak some sense.</p>
<p>The latest piece of advice from the EU regards <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/mar/26/leave-facebook-snooped-on-warns-eu-safe-harbour-privacy-us" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, and they&#8217;re advising citizens to dump the data gatherer from your life, that is if you value your privacy. Well, we warned our readers from the beginning in 2007 that Facebook was an inherently evil data gathering operation run and financed by the spooks, and now the EU is advising to dump Facebook&#8230;hmm</p>
<p>What to do? Dump Facebook or dump the EU, or dump both?</p>
<p>Which one is the lesser of two evils? These are the questions we must ask. Should you abscond to a jungle clearing in Borneo and dump the lot, or just dump Facebook and live in the EU where you are probably being spied on anyway.</p>
<p>Well, the simple truth of the matter is, governments have been spying on citizens since the birth of..er..governments, it&#8217;s just that these days they&#8217;re spying on your every keystroke on the internet. Every citizen within the developed world has large dossiers on themselves, every web page visited, every search term typed, every smartphone conversation is logged and through GPS your every movement is tracked. If you are employed, your employers have vast troves of detailed information about you including your personal life. The insurance industry has all your private data including detailed information of your health records.</p>
<p>So, what is the EU trying to do here? On the one hand they&#8217;re saying, dump Facebook if you value your privacy, on the other hand, the EU member states spy on you every day.</p>
<p>Who should you dump? Facebook which actively sells your private data, including private PMs to any company or entity that pays for it and is an arm of the NSA&#8217;s Prism program, or the collectivist soviet EU which spies on you as well?</p>
<p>Well, it depends on your sensibilities. If you like your data to be logged by the NSA and other American agencies, then keep your Facebook page. If you prefer to be spied on by the EU, then dump your Facebook page, you will still be spied on, just with a more European slant.</p>
<p>C&#8217;est la vie mes amis..</p>

<p>Forgiveness has come swiftly for Andreas Lubitz, the co-pilot who flew the plane into the mountain, as reports filter through that he was a good Christian, a little depressed though, especially after his girlfriend leaving him.</p>
<p>No doubt, this crash will be out of the news faster than a speeding jet hurtling towards a mountain.</p>

<p>The plan to oust the biased Speaker, who always favours the Labour party in parliamentary debates, has been on the Tory agenda for some time but the plot to unseat Bercow failed miserably at the last quarter.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Speaker is meant to be neutral but Bercow is an obvious Labour plant. Him and his awful staunchly Labour supporting wife are a team concocted in the rotting rectum of Gordon Brown&#8217;s era,&#8221; a Tory backbencher said before slinking back behind a curtain.</p>

<p>Conservative backbenchers and MPs are on full alert as rumours swirl of possible action against them, like being bundled into a stained white sheet whilst Mrs Bercow&#8217;s gypsy prize fighter lover lumbers up out of the shadows to beat the living shit out of them. Mr Bercow may even join in kicking them in the shins, such is the desire for revenge from the Speaker.</p>

<p>Being ousted from government, socialist Labour feels its system is being mismanaged by the socialist Tories, as do the millions of people on welfare schemes, therefore the First Past the Post electoral system will ensure the return of the Labour socialist system to its original architects.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can have an extreme right wing leader running the country, but he or she would still be atop a socialist system originally created by the post-war Labour government. Britain is socialist through and through, and there&#8217;s nothing anyone can do about it,&#8221; an unemployed man at a bus stop revealed on his way to the job centre.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>&#8220;A human is a human whether a live infant or an adult, therefore the aborting of human babies is no different to aborting adult humans because they&#8217;re both alive,&#8221; <a href="http://newsbusters.org/blogs/matthew-balan/2015/03/24/cnn-pundit-sally-kohn-excitedly-promotes-abortion-access-bowl-thon" target="_blank">Sally Kohn</a>, a CNN contributor revealed on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Ms Kohn&#8217;s proposal for the Obama administration and entrepreneurs to install Abort Pods across America where people who feel they need to be aborted for the good of the planet has been taken on enthusiastically.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like a public rest room. You put in a coin, walk in and press the big green button. Voila, you&#8217;re aborted. It all happens in a blink of an eye and there&#8217;s no pain. Afterwards, the liquid is simply flushed into the sewer where it is eventually recycled and when Americans turn on their tap, they drink a part of you. It&#8217;s no different to abortions of human babies, because essentially those are alive as well,&#8221; Ms Kohn said with a gleeful smile.</p>
<p>Dot com billionaire Josh Rasmussen, has already taken on the plans and the Obama administration thinks it is an amazing idea worth implementing across the United States.</p>
<p>&#8220;We got an app up and running right now, iAbortPod, available on all app stores. Just book an abortion session and it will tell you which area has a booth and a map to guide you, whether it&#8217;s in use or if there is a queue. You too can reduce your global footprint and carbon emissions by aborting yourself. The scheme is 100% recyclable and just think of the benefit you are doing against global warming.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jane Callous, an MSNBC contributor loves the idea: &#8220;I want to do my bit to halt global warming. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m aborting myself next week at the inauguration ceremony for the first Abort Pod in downtown Los Angeles.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <a href="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ABORT-POD-INTERIOR.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11822" src="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ABORT-POD-INTERIOR.jpg" alt="ABORT POD INTERIOR" width="450" height="355" /></a></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>FAQ</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>1) How will the Abort Pod work?</strong></p>
<p>The ground-breaking technology behind the Abort Pod is secret but it involves a painless and fast way of aborting humans. Once the initial stunning process is completed in less than 5 seconds, the body is liquefied and recycled by being sent to water purification plants to be later reintroduced into the water table. From start to finish the whole process takes two minutes.</p>
<p><strong>2) How much does it cost?</strong></p>
<p>A session in the Abort Pod costs a quarter, yes that&#8217;s 25 cents. Users simply put a quarter into the coin machine and you&#8217;re good to go.</p>
<p><strong>2.5) Can I get a refund?</strong></p>
<p>No, because you&#8217;ll be aborted by then.</p>
<p><strong>3) Will my Facebook page be notified of my abortion?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, once the process is complete, your Facebook and Twitter profiles will update automatically that you have been aborted with a special message of how you have done your bit to halt global warming.</p>
<p><strong>4) What if I change my mind?</strong></p>
<p>Sorry, once you have made your decision and paid up, you will have 2.3 seconds before the process begins, unless you are super human and can move at the speed of light to get out of the locked booth you ain&#8217;t gotta chance in hell.</p>
<p><strong>5) How will this halt global warming? </strong></p>
<p>Well, it&#8217;s simple, the less humans on the earth, the better it is for the environment. Your carbon footprint will be reduced as you won&#8217;t be here any more.</p>
<p><strong>6) Will there be music before the Abort Pod process kicks in?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, there will be a choice of music which you can assign on your app profile. We have a good choice from gentle atmospheric electro dance music to rock, punk or classical. There will also be a recorded message from president Obama, that you are doing the right thing for the environment and an affirmation of your sacrifice.</p>
<p><strong>7) What if I mistook the Abort Pod for a public toilet?</strong></p>
<p>That&#8217;s just too bad.</p>

<p>When Alex Salmond was told that the Labour party is essentially an English political party he was nonetheless even more aggressive with his answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, but they [the Labour party] do not have any policies that favour the English, or Britain. Look what they did in 1997 after the election. Brought economic misery and millions of immigrants from the poorest countries in the world into Britain who are all now on benefits. Gordon did a hatchet job on Britain&#8217;s gold reserves by selling them all off at the bottom of the market, and the rest is history, Britain is still trying to recover from the damage.

<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re a Brit and you come over to America you gotta lick boot, and that&#8217;s why James Corden may have broken the mould of the &#8216;superior&#8217; Brit thing that got people like Piers Morgan into so much trouble, especially with the gun control affair. Americans love to be buttered up, and the celebrities just want to hear about their success all the time, something the Brits don&#8217;t do and it&#8217;s all too down to earth in the UK for the Yanks. Americans don&#8217;t want reality, just hosts that sniff celebrity butt holes and tell them how great they are. Like a shameless whore, James Corden is nothing more than someone who would not be out of place in a day time life insurance commercial or selling PPI, and he&#8217;s cracked America for that very reason. When it comes to dignity, he has none, and is testament to success in the field of effusive flattery for shit loads of money,&#8221; Renfro Grechtener, a TV critic told CBS on Tuesday.</p>
<p>All hail James Corden, an insipid, banal, now Americanised very rich sycophant buttering up the stretch skinned platitudinous trite over-clocked plastic celebrity effluent.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>&#8220;How hard can it be? Car mechanics are technical people anyway and would be up and running on the studio equipment in a jiffy. If Clarkson wants a punch up he&#8217;d get a wrench across his face. It would also make for some great telly, imagine having a team of mechanic producers and Jeremy Clarkson having a full on brawl with pieces of steak and chips flying all over the place. There certainly would be no place for a cheese platter in that mess but ratings would shoot up,&#8221; Niles Pemberton, a commissioning editor who sometimes advises the BBC, revealed on Friday.</p>
<p>One other ex-BBC employee went as far as to suggest employing partially naked female car mechanics for the Top Gear show as producers, at least this way Clarkson may be distracted as would most of the audience and other presenters.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ratings would hit the roof. Imagine having a female car mechanic who not only talks dirty but can grease up the rod bearings on a V12 engine one minute, advise the cameraman to pan right the next whilst booking a hotel room, and smear motor oil over her chest at the same time. If Clarkson wants a steak she&#8217;d throw a frozen one at him. Clarkson would be sitting there like a simpering dog with his tongue hanging out in awe! There&#8217;d be no more nonsense from Clarkson ever again. It&#8217;s a win win situation for the BBC.&#8221;</p>
<p>Either way, it would be a sad day if the left-wing BBC killed off one of Britain&#8217;s eccentrics. That&#8217;s what makes Britain Great, its eccentric characters who bring colour to the drab socialist, politically correct, impotent, boring and turgid moroseness. We need more punch ups, more fucking life, more wildness. AAAaaargh!!!!</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello I am God. Thank you for believing in me with blind unfaltering faith. Yes, it&#8217;s me, don&#8217;t drop the can of sweetcorn you are now holding, just listen.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have chosen you to speak with. You must not listen to that awful Dawkins fellow or that Fry fellow or scientists, or atheists, or anyone with any logic. They&#8217;re obviously going to burn in the fires of hell. I mean, they speak reason, with factual scientific analysis, mathematics, physics, chemistry, astro-physics, computer science, engineering, whereas my flock believes in fairy tales written by simple men who didn&#8217;t even know what bacteria was when they concocted those books to control millions of people and make them do things for them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know why I like people like you? People that do not ask questions when a priest asks them to pray. It&#8217;s your unflinching dedication to being a follower, you&#8217;re a sheep and the shepherd can say, God wants you to go off this cliff, and you do it without question. You were indoctrinated from a young age to not question, to be pliant, even when the paedophile priests took you behind the vestry and asked you to do those things for Jesus.</p>
<p>&#8220;You were also so agreeable to me when you were told to go into battle, to preserve your faith. The fact that the commander who ordered the suicide mission over the trench was dining on a vast banquet with dancing girls fellating him at the time is neither here nor there.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, come, my child. I am your God. I want you to believe in me, I want you to have faith in me, without question. When you are vulnerable this is when the church people pounce on you, they make you feel better, and that&#8217;s when we have you lock stock and barrel. My church also is a place for the community to congregate, this is a natural human desire to be a part of a group, and I like that a lot. The fact that you pray to me is neither here nor there, human gatherings are therapeutic and wholesome affairs for whatever the reason, especially if singing nice songs of blind faith.</p>
<p>&#8220;God&#8217;s church needs money my fellow, and you have given ever so generously. Thank you. Just look at the Catholic branch, cloaked in gold, emeralds, diamonds, with billions in the bank and riches beyond any materialistic thief&#8217;s dreams. They are sincerely doing God&#8217;s work by taking the pliant flock&#8217;s hard earned cash and putting it in their coffers. I am so proud of them. We must also not forget the American branch who serve me, they&#8217;re making absolutely millions of dollars from all believers, especially those wonderful TV evangelists.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your blind faith in the afterlife is a very good way for leaders and people in power to make you accept your meagre existence while they dine off your riches.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want you to continue to believe in me with blind faith. You must read the book every day and believe every word your sheep eyes glance upon. You must believe the earth is only a few thousand years old and dinosaurs never existed, and Jesus walked on water, healed lepers and rose up into the sky. You must believe in all manner of rhubarb as I am your God and I exist.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now without much ado I must must get back to your deepest subconscious. I will only appear in times of strife. But alas, when you die, your brain and consciousness will die too. Oops, did I say that? Sorry to break the news to you, but once you are brain dead that&#8217;s it. Nothing..&#8221;</p>

<p>Professor Dean Perry, a senior fellow working at the Institute of Ancient Research in Denton, Ohio has delved into the recent horrific offering from ISIS.</p>
<p>&#8220;Semiramis, Mary, Diana, Ishtar, the image of the mother and child, Isis, Horus. The symbolism is all too apparent, as the Roman Catholic church adopted Semiramis (Mary) and Tammuz (Jesus) into their rituals in the 5th Century. The Israelites knew her as Ashtarte, mother of Baal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Allilah, Allah, Venus, Diane she is the eternal mother and the symbolism for Semiramis can be found everywhere. From the Catholic churches across the world to the obelisks and statues in major Western cities, to the depths of the Parisian city tunnels.</p>
<p>&#8220;People have a misconception that the Islamic star depicts the sun, when in fact it depicts Venus, and there we have Semiramis. The crescent and star adopted by Islam came from Sumer and ancient Israel, the Moabites, the Babylonians. Byzantine and Roman coins depicted the crescent star way before Islam. ISIS on the other hand have not adopted the crescent and star symbol but have instead gone for an air of authority by emblazoning the words <em>La ‘ilaha ‘illa-llah</em> – “There is no God but God” which were the words used by the Islamic prophet Mohammed as a seal on his letters. The acronym ISIS however is a major clue to the workings of this group.</p>
<p>&#8220;The ritual sacrifice conducted and released by ISIS on the 3 February 2015, a full moon, is indicative of some form of occult working. Whoever is orchestrating the ISIS show is possibly party to ancient knowledge not freely available to the public. There are little clues here and there for you to formulate on who is really behind <a href="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/8348-experts-isis-used-defeat-iran.html" target="_blank">ISIS</a>.&#8221;</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>When it comes to destruction, chaos and disorder, Labour is always the choice for the person who wants to punish any form of success.</p>
<p>Voting for Ed Miliband, and his counterpart, Ed Balls, would naturally be the choice of a person who wished to put a spanner in the works, to undo capitalistic mechanisms and to <em>Sovietize</em> Britain further.</p>
<p>An election win by Labour would immediately soak the rich, and corporations would get plundered of their &#8216;ill gotten&#8217; gains. American internet companies would flee Britain to preserve their money acquired through tax havens. People in multi-million pound houses would overnight be sent to the poor house as Labour brings in punitive taxes that would even be baulked at in staunch socialist Sweden.</p>
<p>The Labour choice is one of destruction of property, where the rich are purloined within an inch of their lives. The royal family will certainly feel some pain, as Miliband would be out to collectivise royal wealth, redistributing funds to the people, and effectively halting Britain&#8217;s House of Windsor.</p>
<p>Once Labour is in power, they would not only increase the already crowded surveillance state but would seal any future election by concocting deals with the Scottish National Party where the Scottish vote would count for Labour&#8217;s electoral extension indefinitely leaving the Tories, who are moribund north of  the Watford gap, without any chance of future re-election.</p>
<p>Taxation of the rich is the key to redistribution of wealth. Miliband&#8217;s plan is to take away so much money from businesses and homes that it will not be profitable any more to own a property or business, let alone a mansion or corporation. In effect, property ownership under Labour will eventually be banned, where only the party hierarchy will be allowed to keep property.</p>
<p>Miliband has made light of his plans for the EU, which he will implement much to the delight of the Germans and French. The pound sterling will be dropped under Labour and the euro currency embraced thus bringing an end to Britain as a nation, subverting its sovereign status to nothing more than a sector in the eurozone.</p>
<p>Bring forth rancid British Rail sandwiches, and make utility companies public. The bankers will feel the worst wrath of Miliband as he curtails the City to no more than a memory of bonuses. The banking industry will be split up into small chunks then vomited out over Canary Wharf, the sight of bankers leaping from their perches will no doubt bring immense pleasure to the disenfranchised masses.</p>
<p>All over Britain, council houses, affordable box living, will make the British countryside unrecognisable. Where the fox once ran, there will be concrete blocks full to the brim of chavs, scallies and Eastern European gangsters. Where the gentle babbling brook once meandered, will be soiled nappies, needles and used condoms.</p>
<p>The NHS must be preserved at all cost, so Miliband will steal the riches of all that have worked hard to earn their livelihood. The welfare state will grow immeasurably dwarfing private business as the state grows.</p>
<p>Britain will see another baby boom, this time with benefits babies growing up in households where they will be encouraged from birth to breed and breed and breed.</p>
<p>Education under Labour will be of servitude to the state, where history will be re-written to indoctrinate children only in Marxist, socialist theory. Children will be taught only about equality, service and welfare. Children will also be encouraged to report their parents or any adults to local state agents if there is any form of dissent.</p>
<p>Many enemies of Britain will thus vote for Labour, as would any terrorists who wish to harm this country. The Islamic State and other entities, as well as Russia are wishing on a Labour win. What better way of ruining a country, without one shot fired, but for it to be killed from the inside out.</p>

<p>Speaking from the Soggy Box cafe in Santa Monica, the actress gave an account to lifestyle show, Flange, how her daily regimen is good for her health and well being: &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing like steaming. Ya know, I was looking through my warm glove box and was chuffed to find a cute little euphemistic recipe book there about steaming. I&#8217;m allowed one Brussels sprout a day so I got home and got my steamer out. A piece of wet lettuce, moist, crunchy right next to it on a plate, it was a paradise slice in a lady garden of dripping pink heaven. There were no badly packed kebabs or greasy meat curtains here stinking up the joint, just good ol&#8217; wholesome steamed snug sprouts. That reminds me, I must have my vagina steam cleaned so it&#8217;s nice and tight.&#8221;</p>
<p>Next week, Paltrow will discuss how she consciously uncoupled herself from the temptations of a burrito.</p>

<p>With North sea oil pretty much worthless at the moment, and the fields nearly dry, it is only natural that the Scots look to rich England to plunder their resources.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aye, the English, we want you tae pay for everything, and we&#8217;re going tae bleed you scunners dry. Not only that, we want a say in your parliament so we can dictate to you bags of puss what goes on in your neck of woods. How&#8217;s about that for a kick in the nads.

<p>&#8220;The founder of the EU, Jean Monnet, always said that economic/political crisis would be utilised to bring ever closer union within the EU, and we precipitated this crisis. These Marxists cannot fight an entity that is both Marxist and Fascist as the EU. We have amalgamated every political doctrine into our policies and cannot be defined by left or right. The EU is a bigger technical entity than many could imagine.</p>
<p>&#8220;Syriza, you are part of our game, and you fooled the Greek people very well. You have ensured the enslavement of your people and you will be honoured for your trickery, thank you. Our plans are still intact.</p>
<p>&#8220;Podemos, now it is your turn to fool the Spanish people as the Greeks were so easily fooled. We will help you rise in secret.</p>
<p>&#8220;Italy&#8217;s 5 Star Movement, talking of movements, I had a wiener schnitzel last night that disagreed with my bowels, but back to the subject, you too will rise and we will help you to take over. We will feign opposition.</p>
<p>&#8220;In France, we have many avenues, and these will all be exploited for our gain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Austerity my dear sheep is simply another name for poverty, we are re-introducing feudalism to Europe. You will have smart metres forcibly installed in all properties enforcing limited energy usage, you will have rations of food, and we will introduce for your own safety, of course, internal micro chipping so that you and your children can be safe.</p>
<p>&#8220;As for the British, they will never leave the EU. It would be financial suicide for them, corporations are too entwined within our framework. Their politicians take orders from us, we own them whichever party they come from, including the ultimate trickster Farage and Cameron. Promises are always changed once a party fools enough people in an election.</p>
<p>Resistance is futile, as the insignificant sheeple voted for the EU, we will make you bleed for us, the few who are at the top of the pyramid. You deserve the government you voted for, and citizens of the EU are the most pliant mutton, easy to fool, over and over again. We look upon you with disdain and contempt, as you pay for our unlimited expense budgets. We laugh in your faces, and the funny thing is, you will never wake up, the citizens are tricked eternally.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please vote because it does not mean a thing, your vote is meaningless under the control of the EU, but you will never see that will you? We have two eyes, you have none, the blind people of the EU only existing in darkness.&#8221;</p>

<p>“It’s gonna be like the Red Neck Games but with some women who think they can do politics. Personally I can’t wait,” Esparto Dunce, a political commentator on Capitol Hill told Fox news.</p>
<p><strong>Buck Wild</strong></p>
<p>According to election organisers, on the day of the election, a big mud wrestling pit will be constructed directly outside the White House grounds which will be made to look like Hazzard County. All the TV networks have already signed up for the 2016 Presidential All Girl Mud Wrestle Fest, current president Barack Obama will be watching, probably with much amusement, and is even urging Michelle to join in.</p>
<p>A mud wrestling aficionado from Kentucky, Balthazar Mulrones told Fox news: “Dang I can’t wait. I’m gonna get some rotten tomatoes to throw at ‘em. I’m rooting for Sarah Palin, she’s a wild one, but y’all gotta watch out for Hillary, a mean mangy player who don&#8217;t mind playin&#8217; dirty.”</p>

<p>This same strategy seems to work on the International relations front, where the Western propaganda machine has been working overtime to discredit Russia on all fronts. Just say Blyat, and get on with the job at hand.</p>
<p>The cabin is filling with smoke at 35,000 feet. Fuck it, have another drink.</p>
<p>The Russian economy has been given junk status by an American ratings agency, reach for the vodka and say Blyat. But here&#8217;s the clincher, if the Americans are giving the Russians junk status, what happens when analysts look at the real deficit of the U.S. economy? That&#8217;s actually below junk status, and if anyone knew what was really happening in the American economy there would be some serious crying in the streets.</p>
<p>Russians are a hardy people, very resilient, jovial, of course with a touch of melancholy and it is to this end that the Americans can throw anything they want at these Russians and they will simply keep on doing what they&#8217;re doing. They don&#8217;t need credit cards, lattes or awful banal American sitcoms, they don&#8217;t need canned laughter, just give &#8216;em some boiled cabbage soup, a litre of vodka and a Kalashnikov.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>Satirists and cartoonists should be praised all over the world for the sheer dedication to bringing forth questions and answers to our worldly problems.</p>
<p>The unflinching hard headed nature of satire is a big fuck you to hypocrisy and the disenfranchised totality of society.</p>
<p>People have died in the name of satire and they stuck to their staunch beliefs, pens still in their hands as the bullets rained down on them.</p>
<p>In 2013, the Daily Squib itself was punished severely by the Obama administration  when we wrote an article on <a href="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/3734-obamacare-subtitle-c-11-section-2521.html" target="_blank">Obamacare</a>. Our SEO analysts analysed the data after the immediate date of publication and noticed a drastic 80% drop across the world in traffic. What&#8217;s more our site was nearly removed from Google. Thousands of links across the web were immediately erased only leaving a few remnants of our site. Our previously high traffic YouTube channel was blacklisted and has been put in the slow lane ever since. Whilst we do not blame Google who were only taking orders, the question must arise, that article must have hit some kind of nerve.</p>
<p>This is not free speech and the Daily Squib vows to continue writing satire even though we have barely recovered from the deluge of prohibition on our site.</p>
<p>Western civilisation should stand for freedom, not inhibition and underhand crippling techniques limiting free speech &#8212; only tyranny and terror are enemies of free speech.</p>
<p>Satirists everywhere must stick to their guns/pens whatever their struggle &#8212; to write what they write and depict whatever they depict.</p>
<p>Freedom in the so-called free West has sadly been thwarted, we are urging people to support satirists everywhere, they fight through the mass of prohibition for an essence of the truth unlike the controlled media, they are the other side, the unseen heroes who grasp for freedom with their pens.</p>
<p>If you value freedom, if you value the truth, hug a satirist today, support us, because if we don&#8217;t do something now, things will get a lot worse for society as a whole.</p>
<p>There is love in satire, because we see the bad and the good as it really is, it may mock but this world can only be cured by hard love, and that is what satire is, the hard truth, sent with love that some will not like, but the truth is our love to you. We love you and we put ourselves forward with opposite views, different configurations, lateral thoughts and streams of reality from behind the masks and curtains of satire.</p>
<p>The Daily Squib can see the future and is a warning to civilisation, humility, understanding, and the spirit of Juvenal.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>The world at the moment is not a very humorous place, and there are many variables to illustrate this point.</p>
<p>The Daily Squib is a staunch believer in freedom of speech, it does not have nationality, religion or creed, it is merely a mirror of everything, timeless with no allegiance to any political party, faction or conglomerate, however we are knowledgeable and not ignorant to the dangers of attacking in writing the prophet of Islam. Muslims are still 400 years behind in religious evolution and were never party to a Rennaissence or Enlightenement like the European Christians. It is this profound ignorance that got members of Charlie Hebdo murdered as they should have had some knowledge of the situation, especially with their depiction of the Islamic prophet.</p>
<p>It is not just Islamic fanaticism that has constrained the media and Internet but it also has been stifled by the crippling farce of political correctness, a leftist vestige of communist soviet speech and control technique.</p>
<p>After the Charlie Hebdo shooting incident, it was interesting to see president Obama saying that free speech should be preserved, a rather hypocritical statement considering his record of skewing news in his favour and of cutting off news broadcasters from their viewers if they do not tow the line.</p>
<p>In the face of religious fundamentalism, political correctness is just as insidious yet without the bullets and knives.</p>
<p>Feminism also falls under the soviet technique of political correctness and is vastly damaging to free speech.</p>
<p>True freedom of speech should involve all points of view, whether pleasing to the controlling faction or not. If we want the whole picture, we must be able to take all flavours, and if you do not like one particular point, why not exercise your free will and gain your sustenance from elsewhere instead of going around and reporting something that offends you, just walk away, respect free speech.</p>
<p>Does lack of privacy enter the equation of free speech? Yes it does, and under the Obama regime, the NSA in America, and GCHQ in Britain have targeted journalists and news organisations, thus limiting what these organisations can say or do. This hinders free speech. It is all well and good citing the threat of terrorism for an increase in spying but that should not involve blanket spying on everyone, but targeted action against terrorism instead. Because of a few acts from a few people, why is it that the whole populace has to lose all their privacy and thus all be treated as terrorists? This is counter to everything the West stands for, and only reinforces those who seek to harm those who deem themselves free.</p>
<p>The notion of freedom itself is multi faceted, and we in the West claim to be free but if you look closely, you will realise the opposite is true. There is very limited freedom in the West today, one only has to look at the recent Scottish referendum to see how propaganda techniques were utilised to force a No vote. The same is sure to happen for the supposed EU referendum, which will probably never materialise anyway.</p>
<p>Instead of arresting trolls on Twitter or Facebook because some ninny got offended by a few words, would it not be better to get the police to arrest real criminals and terrorists?</p>
<p>Lest we forget the outspoken obvious joker, Katie Hopkins who is a professional agitator, she was recently nearly arrested for saying something about Jocks in Scotland. An utterly ridiculous incident where the PC brigade started a campaign to have her account deleted and reported her to the police. The PC thought police have nothing better to do obviously, especially whilst the real dangers are all around and yet they cannot see them instead choosing to twat about on Twitter.</p>
<p>Political correctness is now an agenda which is all prevailing, it curtails free speech, uses a mob mentality to police its agenda, and is equal in its prohibitive nature as Islamic fundamentalism.</p>

<p>Back in September 2014 there were suggestions of such <a href="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/9459-military-experts-west-must-send-troops-iraq.html" target="_blank">actions</a> which were not heeded by Western governments, however with the recent shooting at the offices of French magazine, Charlie Hebdo in which twelve people were mercilessly gunned down, there is no other course for the West.</p>
<p>Costly air strikes are useless, and we wrote about that in <a href="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/9832-military-experts-bombing-belief-system-futile.html" target="_blank">2014</a> as well. Not only have the United States been dropping supplies on the door step of Islamic fighters but they have been spending billions of dollars on limited air strikes on an enemy that is transient and fluid. When George W. Bush and Tony Blair attacked Iraq and Afghanistan in 2003, they unleashed a legacy that will live with the West for a very long time.</p>
<p>Time is running out for the West, its tenets of freedom of speech are moot when the waiting Islamic fighters have all the time in the world to fight and fight while the West&#8217;s leaders do nothing. Limited military action on the ground will not suffice either, it has to be full military conscription for every man and woman.</p>

<p><strong>If you ever thought about joining the army, navy or air force, now is a good time to put this into action. </strong></p>
<p><strong>If you have never thought about joining the military, now is a good time to start preparing and thinking about it. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Full military conscription is the only way to proceed before it is too late. Increasing military budgets by 70% is the only way forward.<br />

<p>&#8220;He came in the morning, and I had my pet sheep Dimples with me. I wanted to show him some farm yard animals as I was great fan of the Cosby Show. Then in the afternoon I was calling for Dimples, couldn&#8217;t find her anywhere. Bill came around the corner and said he had just been checking out the bushes. I thought nothing of it,&#8221; Elroone Draper, recalled.</p>
<p>After Bill Cosby had made his excuses, he left the farm and this is when things got really weird for Draper.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was tending the farm, and still no sight of Dimples. Then I saw something twitching in the bushes, it was Dimples. She looked kinda groggy. I got her up on her feet and saw she couldn&#8217;t walk all that good. You know with all this stuff in the news recently I had to say something. I still remember my little ol&#8217; Dimples, how she just wasn&#8217;t right after that episode. Years later I showed her a picture of Bill Cosby. Never seen her run away so fast in my life.&#8221;</p>

<p>Take Hillary Clinton&#8217;s bid to become the first female president of the United States in 2016, well, she does have a small problem, her husband Bill Clinton, the guy with twenty phone numbers and a penchant for young ladies on the end of his dong.</p>
<p>What about the upstanding former prime minister of Britain, a whistle clean respected individual who started an Iraq war killing millions of people, brought the UK to its knees economically and ruined a media mogul&#8217;s marriage by allegedly shagging his wife?</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget the British royal family who have had their expensive PR campaigns over the years ruined in one night by candid reports and allegations regarding Prince Andrew.</p>
<p>Niles Gardiner, a prominent researcher at the Institute of Elite Resource Management had this to say in a recent analysis of the whole sordid situation.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is quite simple, if a member of the political hierarchy or any other person of power is ever caught, it is not the fault of the sex slaves who blabbed, it is the fault of the person who got caught. Somewhere along the line they did the wrong thing, said the wrong thing to someone higher than them. That&#8217;s why you get a little blood letting once in awhile of establishment figures. Epstein was an obvious set up. These occasions also sate some of the bloodlust of the masses, and gives a feeling that there is a rule of law even for some lower echelons of the elite. The every day man or woman is pleased by such shows and it placates the general populace. These minor elites will naturally get a little rap on the knuckles, nothing too severe. Do remember that the real elites are not visible, anyone who is visible is at a low rank. The real elites have carte blanche to do whatever they want without reproach or question.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Open borders, useless airport screening, and a buckling NHS are naturally good breeding grounds for any virus to flourish, especially one of the most virulent killers man has ever known, Ebola. Don&#8217;t forget that Ebola doesn&#8217;t show itself for 25 days after infection, and during that time it can be transmitted through bodily fluids. Sneeze in the underground, on the bus, touch a supermarket credit card reader pad, touch a fucking library book, ah the list goes on and on. How about nightclubs? How&#8217;s about some gal gets picked up by someone who just got off a plane from Sierra Leone or other African destination, goes back home, he does the business, now she&#8217;s got Ebola. She doesn&#8217;t know that, nah, then she gets a visit from her boyfriend, he sleeps with her, now he&#8217;s got Ebola. Those nightclubs and bars do get sweaty don&#8217;t they, well Ebola sweat isn&#8217;t like normal sweat is it? You get Ebola sweat on you, it goes in the pores and all,&#8221; a taxi driver told his passenger somewhere in East London on the way to a club on Saturday night.</p>
<p>The Black Death from 1348-1349 killed half the population of Britain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Prison is much like boarding school in England, cold, dingy and having to be careful when picking up the soap in the showers. It will be like the good old days but without the evening&#8217;s prep. One was always eager to get away for exeat, and I have heard some prisons in America allow conjugal visits, perhaps a young filly or three can visit me then. As for electrical chairs, how ghastly, one&#8217;s deviant alleged crimes do not warrant such absurdities although it could be rather thrilling, come to think of it,&#8221; the prince jovially told ITN news reporter, Melvyn Shappes, on Saturday.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>London has always been a cosmopolitan city, but what exists today is something completely different, it&#8217;s a place where a person cannot breathe any more, a place where a person cannot ride on the overflowing transport system, a place where the narrow streets are impassible from the volume of traffic, a place where gangs of roaming thugs or aggressive EU beggars threaten those in their way, a place where the sheer volume of people never ends with a limitless influx, a place where the true spirit of London has sadly been lost forever.</p>
<p>There is an understanding that globalist pressures are under way, however Britain is but a small isle, it has little space left for the momentum and speed of the vast influx. One must also consider the overcrowded underfunded schools, the faltering NHS hospitals splitting with the sheer volume influx, the public transport systems that cannot cope and the stationary roads where vehicles are meant to move forward to their destination and not sit in endless traffic jams.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is simply about space. What are they going to do next, put people on top of people? We already live in thin rows, rats in a tiny box. Try driving through the bloody roads, if you drive across from North to South London you&#8217;ll be lucky to do it in a day. Most of London has also been hit by the phenomenon that no one talks about called &#8216;white flight&#8217; and this has left whole swathes of London looking like, well not London any more, but no one acknowledges this fact, you won&#8217;t hear any politicians or celebrities talking about &#8216;white flight&#8217; but much of London has suffered. The EU disaster of no borders has caused permanent damage to our beloved London, and of course it was Tony Blair&#8217;s Labour government who precipitated this influx by letting in over eight million people from some of the poorest countries in the former Soviet bloc. Something has to be done some day, someone has to help those who stayed in their city, a place we have in our blood, our ancestors, our former capital city,&#8221; a Londoner told no one at an overcrowded bus stop.</p>
<p>Should there not be a sensible policy of immigration, much like New Zealand and Australia? Instead, Britain and its capital city in particular, have been rendered as depositories. There will not be an NHS in five years time, there will not be a welfare system for those in need, there will not be a place for Londoners who grew up in this great city to live in ten years time. This is not about racism, jingoism, xenophobia or anything else, it is about physics. Small space large volume of influx at high speed.</p>

<p>Royal watchers are astonished at the negligent ignorance Americans hold towards the royal family.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s absolutely classless to say that Prince Andrew allegedly met with this young lady when she was only seventeen years of age. Don&#8217;t they know that the age of consent in Britain is sixteen? And even if he did, it is no business of theirs to meddle with royal matters. These squalid yokel cowboys are nothing more than peasants in the eyes of the British royal family. We witnessed their vulgarity when the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge recently visited that awful toilet called New York. They have no manners and should know their place, which is 1000 fathoms below blue blood and will never be equal to it in a million years,&#8221; Sir Whittington Smythe, a friend of the royals told the BBC.</p>

<p>&#8220;Obama&#8217;s action regarding U.S. foreign policy is to ensure the Neocons gain power in 2016. What he is doing is a reverse psychological advance play which causes Americans to ask what is going on in the Middle East? The American people are used to their government going to war at the drop of a hat, and yet here is Obama dismantling every notion they are used to. It&#8217;s a very simple strategy, a nonchalant attitude is adopted which leaves the people clamouring for war, it is a brilliant military strategy in reverse of the Bush administration&#8217;s sudden Gulf war which caused a lot of anti-war sentiment. When the public is against the actions of government, there is a drawback, especially when recruiting bodies for the military, the government wants people to be for war, not against it. What do the people&#8217;s opinion matter anyway? Well, when it comes to the supposed elections, there has to be some form of support from the dumbed down American population. It is better if they want war, because then they will freely give up their sons and daughters to the military machine. In any election within a so-called democratic system, it does not matter who wins an election, the people who work behind the scenes are still there, therefore the visible government may simply be a different colour, blue or red, but it&#8217;s just a different side of the same coin. This is how the fraud of democracy works, it is simply a method of bending public opinion towards a certain direction, then introducing a new president. You as a voter may think you voted, but you didn&#8217;t, because the system is designed in a relatively intricate manner which clouds the real intent of those behind the scenes. Vote Rep or Dem you get the same outcome. We want the public to clamour for war, to scream it from the roof tops, because then we will send your kids to have their legs blown up by IEDs in some dust riven shit hole.&#8221; Lewis Warre, a Pentagon military advisor told CNN.</p>
<p>The Neocon strategy will thus be, look at Obama, he pulled America from these countries and now there is a big mess. Let us, the Neocons fix this mess, all you have to do is give us your sons and daughters. Meanwhile, behind the scenes, there will be high fives around, with a big pat on the back for Obama. The big war is yet to come, you will see it, you will know what is going on, but you will be powerless to stop it because you will want it so bad.</p>
<p>Hail, the age of the resurgent Neocon, coming back for the final curtain call.</p>

<p>Psychologist Ariel Tabule, reveals his analysis: &#8220;Black Friday is a mass ritual of consumerist brainwashing wherein the controlled masses are triggered to spend as much money as they possibly can on useless junk. Naturally those who control the masses have certain techniques which I shall not divulge here, although you may have a slight understanding of the triggers they utilise to get idiots and fucking morons to part with their cash in the least dignified manner.</p>
<p><strong>Brown Saturday</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;This is when the idiots are at home and have had a good night&#8217;s rest. Their hypnotic state may have worn off slightly. They have by now unwrapped their purchases, and realise they have been conned. The funny thing is, it works every year, and they fall for the same tricks over and over again. Brown Saturday, look at your credit card bills, let out a large groan. Rinse and repeat next year.&#8221;</p>

<p>The PM&#8217;s press officer always lends a hand by bringing out a little black board for him to put forward his message with some pieces of chalk.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not that he doesn&#8217;t want to say anything, it&#8217;s just that what he says is sort of meaningless and transparent, almost like some kind of insipid jelly fish,&#8221; Peter Pesseltripe, Cameron&#8217;s press officer told the Telegraph.</p>
<p>David Cameron&#8217;s latest speech about EU immigration was thus reduced to a few scribblings on the board.</p>
<p>&#8220;Election, S.O.S, Help! Deflect until after election. Pro EU plan still in place. Need to win. Appease mob first. Help!&#8221;</p>

<p>Gone are the genteel days of cucumber sandwiches and the odd half arsed swing, these days bowlers are trained to deliver balls to batsmen with almost bionic strength and speed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not like the old days. They used to call cricket the gentleman&#8217;s game, now if you get away with a fractured skull and mild brain damage you&#8217;re lucky. It&#8217;s vicious out there, especially us Aussies. Bodyline? That was sissy stuff, now we can get bowlers to bounce the ball directly into your frontal neocortex. Howzat for precision?&#8221; an Australian cricket commentator revealed on Thursday.</p>
<p>The new kevlar reinforced steel helmets will be issued in June 2015 for the Australian Cricket Federation. Coming in at 77 kgs, the helmets are resistant to 9mm bullets and may even save cricketers lives.</p>

I&#8217;d be delighted to write a cheque out on behalf of British taxpayers to the European Union for that small amount. We certainly do not need that money, we&#8217;ve got a surplus here, the NHS is doing very well and our welfare spending is tiny.

<p>&#8220;Hi, I&#8217;m the peculiar analyst, been around for awhile, let&#8217;s just put it down to a few millennia. You know, one little thing I have noticed about today is no one knows their place any more. If everyone thinks they&#8217;re kings and queens with a voice, then all we have is useless chatter, to me it&#8217;s all meaningless and counter-productive, to put it lightly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s look at the despots who were placed into position in the Middle East many years ago. Well, they were removed rather unceremoniously by the global boys and look at what we have now. It&#8217;s not very nice, what with all that war, Isis and such, but the dictators of the past kept the peace. Arabs need to have strong dictatorial leaders otherwise their beastly nature comes through.</p>
<p>&#8220;The same applies to our neck of the woods. Granted, the days of Downtown are gone, however this global stuff is rather irksome. Mixing all these people in a big bucket is injurious, not only for the people being mixed up but for the people mixing it up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Riots I hear you say? Naturally, there will be many, because rats do get rather agitated when they&#8217;re stuck in a cage piled on each other. More abortions would do the trick, give us all a rest from these cockroaches and rats piled on top of each other. How about a bit of Ebola or a Ferguson riot or twenty? Some people need to be told what to do all the time, they can&#8217;t function without it. Certainly, slavery is a necessary evil and hopefully one day we may move from covert back to overt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh everybody&#8217;s got a voice now. How endearing that is, because in my opinion, if everyone has a voice, then the music stops. It&#8217;s a classless system engineered where voices and opinions are not created by the hit makers but by the mass of people. There lies the difference, there is no quality control, it&#8217;s messy and to tell you the truth smells a bit but it keeps the hordes busy with entertainment. Their voice is their own prison, their own hell.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know, I long for the day when people quieten down a bit, a little more introspection would be nice. Where the troglodytes don&#8217;t have to vomit out every inane thought they have or take pictures of their tea posting it on twatter. I detest social media, it is a machine that was designed solely to fool people into thinking they had a voice, but we all know the truth now, it is simply an early warning system for the boys up top. There are no pubs any more to have a good listen, to see what the common man is thinking..or plotting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyway, until next time, fuck off you plebs and leave me to drink my glass filled with thoughts of utopia.&#8221;</p>

<p>Speaking at the Oval office, Obama (Jimmy Carter 2.0) was very calm about the recent events: &#8220;It&#8217;s nothing to worry about, once ISIS reaches Baghdad, all we gots to do is bomb that place into non existence then it&#8217;s gonna be Mission Accomplished.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for the last minute bombing gesture, which has proved largely ineffective so far, maybe Obama&#8217;s late arrival into the ISIS affair is of course a great opportunity to call for a Global military force to tackle such events.</p>
<p>Looks like Baghdadians will soon be drinking from the coffee cup of ISIS, or should that be a chalice filled with blood at the newly opened Bagdad Cafe.</p>
<p>How much blood do you want in your Latte?</p>

<p>As Obama&#8217;s henchman in chief, Eric Holder resigns &#8211; a man who was way too preoccupied by racial issues to do his job &#8211; Obama is forced to acknowledge the sphere of global influence.</p>
<p>Obama still has a lot to learn as his naive understanding of geo-political machinations is in its early phase, however his team of writers and advisers are always there to guide him.</p>
<p>The president&#8217;s keynote speech at the UN recently regarding the threat of ISIS, possibly penned by CFR experts, is a sign that the United States is once again ready to enter the world stage after a brief period of absence.</p>
<p>Describing Obama&#8217;s presidency in a simplistic way, it can be described with one sentence: First black man elected, tried to deal with being a black man in charge, got hated on a lot, was mildly accepted towards the end when bigger global threats arose.</p>
<p>The people who installed Obama into power, no names included, knew that it would be a struggle to have someone from a minority group supposedly in charge, they knew that influential Jewish media outlets like Drudge report and Breitbart would be on his case every second of the day, and it is a credit to Obama that he surfed the wave with idle care.</p>
<p>As for the Daily Squib, we are merely mirrors of everything, and reflect onto the waters of global consciousness what is seen through the all seeing Squib eye.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>There is no doubt that threats to Western global hegemony like ISIS are a danger to the new world order, however, simplistic methods of eradication like indiscriminate bombing are impotent methods that only throw away money.</p>
<p>First, one must understand how a belief system works and how it powers the masses. Organised religions like Islam, Christianity and Judaism subscribe to a belief system that controls the mass of devout followers.</p>
<p>You cannot destroy a belief system by bombing it, because it resides in thin air, in the minds of the followers.</p>
<p>Simply by bombing areas where you think a belief system exists is futile and is merely an empty gesture wasting expensive rockets.</p>
<p>Furthermore, by bombing areas where a perceived threat emanates, one only creates more entrenched fanaticism within the belief system that lies there. The belief system is thus seen as being under attack, it provides a good recruiting tool by the belief system&#8217;s controllers. For every ISIS believer killed by a bomb, there are hundreds who will take their place. Strategically speaking, ISIS are an amorphous group, they do not have bases, they move around, this is why bombing is a complete waste of time and money, and is an empty gesture that will only enhance hatred towards the West, especially if collateral damage is incurred.</p>
<p>The only way to kill a belief system can be revealed here: Every participant of that belief system has to be eradicated, and that is called genocide. This is something, within the modern era, that is not acceptable by many, however throughout human history it has been utilised countless times to annihilate whole groups either to extinction or weaken them to practical non existence.</p>
<p>The Islamic State, as it wishes to be called, is a militant arm of Islam, which as a religion and belief system has no central control point or &#8216;church&#8217; as it is all encompassing over multiple global regions. Therefore, the only way to defeat the Islamic State is to either eradicate every Muslim from the planet as well as to eradicate every form of mass religion including Christianity. The West is predominantly Christian, therefore if it attacks another religious belief system, it is immediately viewed as one belief system attacking another.</p>
<p>If the West was truly interested in eradicating ISIS they would eradicate Christianity as well. Religious belief systems only lead to war, however moderate they may seem at any point.</p>
<p>The rationalists, realists and revolutionaries within Western nations who propose war hold different ideologies of the technical abilities of war; the underlying core of their modus operandi is one of complete global governance and the establishment of a New World Order. It seems that there are fronts on many sides, with China, Russia as well as the Islamic belief system. The latter it seems is an excellent tool to bring about chaos from which order will eventually be restored.</p>
<p>Bombing is futile of any belief system. If there is ever to be any form of seriousness to this affair, Western governments must introduce compulsory military service for the populations and eradicate religion. Otherwise, the rest is just fluff, and the problems will keep getting worse, and worse, ending in the ultimate defeat of the West.</p>

<p>We conducted the interview in Alex Salmond&#8217;s home town of Glasgow in his council flat which he shares with his pet budgie Angus and a few heroin addicts on the estate.</p>
<p><strong>DS</strong>: So how are things after the disastrous referendum vote which many see as Scotland having being robbed of freedom?</p>
<p><strong>Salmond</strong>: I&#8217;ll always be defiant to the end, it&#8217;s not over even if the fucking cat purrs, and don&#8217;t count us out yet, we Scots have a wee bit more fight in us.</p>
<p><strong>DS</strong>: Since your resignation as SNP leader, how have you been spending your time?</p>
<p><strong>Salmond</strong>: You ever heard of Special Brew? Well, I&#8217;ve been downing a lot of that, also whisky, crack cocaine and a wee bit heroin just to calm my nerves. I have a lot of time on my hands now, I go down the benefits office and get my giro, by mid afternoon spent the lot. It&#8217;s not easy. This is how 90% of us Scots live our short lives.</p>
<p><strong>DS</strong>: What do you think of Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling?</p>
<p><strong>Salmond</strong>: I can&#8217;t say the words here, but I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re Scottish. In the old days they would&#8217;ve been strung up on a tree and dealt with the way way we deal with traitors.</p>
<p><strong>DS</strong>: Do you feel let down by big business?</p>
<p><strong>Salmond</strong>: It&#8217;s called blackmail where I come from, they threatened people, so they voted no. If you scare people enough they&#8217;ll do anything.</p>
<p><strong>DS</strong>: Do you think it was right for the Queen of England to intervene during the referendum?</p>
<p><strong>Salmond</strong>: Put it plainly, no is the answer to that. It was a very well placed sentence, she wanted people to think carefully. Now I&#8217;m a politician and I know if people think that can be dangerous for them. Well, there it was, the answer was no independence for Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>DS</strong>: Yes, but to be honest you didn&#8217;t have much of a detailed plan for the Scottish economy did you?</p>
<p><strong>Salmond</strong>: Excuse me (Salmond takes a swig from a can and burps loudly). Plans are for sissies, we were about getting our freedom, where there&#8217;s a will there&#8217;s a way, we would have been like the next tax haven or something, you know like Switzerland.</p>
<p><strong>DS</strong>: Do you think there will be another chance for Scotland to gain its freedom?</p>
<p><strong>Salmond</strong>: No. That&#8217;s it for Scotland. We&#8217;re a beaten people now, because we&#8217;re not Scotland any more. Same thing happened in Northern Ireland. Once you let them in, that&#8217;s it. Now fuck off, I&#8217;ve got a date with some meth.</p>
<p>The interview ended abruptly when our reporter was kicked out of Salmond&#8217;s dingy flat.</p>

<p>As for Phones4U, they don&#8217;t have much of a customer service do they? I tried calling their support line and the recorded message told me they&#8217;d all gone home &#8212; permanently.</p>
<p>The state of British business of late, tsk, tsk, it&#8217;s as if it&#8217;s second fiddle to the economy.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to transfer Larry the tabby cat to Buckingham palace and bring the Queen into Downing Street. We just hope the loud purring sounds don&#8217;t distract the Cabinet meetings,&#8221; a Number 10 spokeswoman added.</p>
<p>Prince Philip, who hates cats, on hearing the news was furious and vowed to set the corgis on the poor moggy once he is delivered to Buckingham palace.</p>
<p>In related news, David Cameron may visit the Tower of London soon, alongside SNP leader Alex Salmond where they will be imprisoned for the rest of their lives.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s bad enough as it is, but with Ed Miliband in charge, prepare for an exodus of pretty much all taxpayers. All will be left are those on the dole, illegal immigrants and benefits families. Who&#8217;s going to pay the vast punishing Labour taxes then?&#8221; a professional businessman told the Financial Times.</p>
<p>Labour&#8217;s plan to take away earnings from hard working Britons will mean that there will be an exodus of many professionals to friendlier shores, away from the horrid thought that pretty much every penny earned is taken away to pay for the feckless.</p>
<p><strong>But where to go?</strong></p>
<p>Anywhere out of the eurozone is a safe bet, because Ed Miliband and his evil socialist henchmen and women are also seeking to incorporate the crumbling euro currency and destroy Britain from the inside out.</p>
<p>Hopefully by the time Miliband is in power, the democrats (American socialists) will have been ousted from America, although a long shot with the level of brainwashing of American voters.</p>
<p>Africa is out of the question obviously as it is prone to deadly viruses and war.</p>
<p>The Middle East is out of bounds because it is entrenched in war.</p>
<p>Russia is out of bounds because it is in a state of war.</p>
<p>The Far East could be okay, however avoid China like the plague.</p>
<p>South America is a possibility but beware that security is an issue and you will be in danger of kidnap, arrest, thievery or general death.</p>
<p>If you are rich enough, you may try Switzerland or Monaco otherwise forget about it.</p>
<p>If anyone has any ideas please leave a comment about where to go in the world that is safe.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is even more scary than a visit from Lord Voldemort, or the dark Lord Mandelson,&#8221; a defiant Potter said whilst cooking up the Expeliafappus potion.</p>
<p>Hogwarts has been put on high alert, as the threat of an Intruder charm beckons on Hermione&#8217;s treasure chest.</p>
<p>Things have certainly changed since the Hogwarts alumni have got all grown up and left the school of magic, the real world seems even more terrible than school.</p>
<p>Time is running out, let&#8217;s hope Harry&#8217;s magic works or Hermione may have to escape to Azkaban.</p>

<p>To tell you the truth, unless you&#8217;re a pubescent fapping boy, the Fappening Part Deux is not that great, I mean who hasn&#8217;t seen Kim Kardashian&#8217;s <em>vagine </em>and bloated arse before?</p>
<p>Most men will simply look at this movie and say, yeah, not bad, nothing special, still tappable in some cases.</p>
<p>As for the Hillary Duff spread, one could imagine themselves on the set of a sci fi movie about to get sucked into a massive black hole.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s not leave it to the imagination any more, this film will have you coming back for more, and more and more.</p>
<p>Part Deux fans will not be disappointed to hear that Jennifer Lawrence does feature again, but the image of her glazed face from the original Fappening movie will stick in our minds for an eternity.</p>
<p>The Fappening Part Deux also features some great soccer scenes, we won&#8217;t spoil the plot but there&#8217;s some awesome penalty shots saved by American goal keeper Hope Solo.</p>
<p>Does one feel sorry for these wayward lasses? Not really, they knew what they were doing, they were adults. Let&#8217;s not excuse the feckless idiots who don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s happening in the world, and can&#8217;t read, or simply want to exist in a netherworld of complete ignorance.</p>
<p>The premier for the Fappening Part Deux will be held on some day or other, and when the girls roll up onto the red carpet, everyone will simply point and wink. What else can you do after you&#8217;ve seen their most private parts spread wide open, is that right Bar Refaeli?</p>
<p>Many cinemagoers can&#8217;t wait till the Fappening Part Trois, maybe some Taylor Swift cameos are afoot, it&#8217;s a good thing there are plentiful supplies of toilet roll in this world.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s something about having a nice refreshing cuppa, especially when you&#8217;ve got some beheadings to do and the American drones are flying overhead looking for ISIS targets to vapourise.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a builder by trade, and as you know used to having a cuppa every five minutes, but looks like the Jihadis here don&#8217;t do that. They told me one cuppa in the morning and maybe one at night, that is if I&#8217;m not dead by then,&#8221; John bin Brittani, revealed in Geehads magazine recently.</p>
<p>News from the front travels fast on twitter, and Jihadi commanders have been seen tearing their beards out at the quality of the British jihadis.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had one bloke from Salford, Manchester, this geezer said he needed a cup of brew every twenty minutes. He even took his flask with him on operations. I said to him, &#8216;ere mate, we&#8217;re getting shot at, put the flask away. He just wouldn&#8217;t have it would he, next thing I know, he&#8217;s got his tea and crumpets out with a big grin on his face. Poor fella didn&#8217;t make it past his first day, we found him with a cup of piping Earl Grey under a tree and a bullet in him,&#8221; Commander of the Al Britanni Brigade, revealed on a recent BBC Newsnight special.</p>

<p>&#8220;Generational nationalism and religion are the causes of most of the world&#8217;s problems. Nationalism was utilised by leaders in the past to gain strategic ground, however if globalisation is to occur, there must be an abrogation of all nationalism and organised religion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunately the world&#8217;s population is still entrenched in petty squabbles about such things as race, territory and religious ideology. The human animal is naturally a territorial beast much like any, but these human qualities are the ones that may lead to its ultimate downfall. Territorial disputes over limited finite resources within a rapidly expanding human population are another major cause for concern as they create disharmony and war.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the global community is to transcend these historical biological human pitfalls, there may have to be an ultimate external threat that will render all of humanity&#8217;s differences void.</p>
<p>&#8220;One major point however that may have to be addressed by the global elite, is the natural order of nature, where the globalists fail, is in their urgency to declare all humans as equal, when in reality there are major biological genetic differences in races, not only in intelligence levels, but through selective breeding through the centuries, especially within the governing classes.</p>
<p>&#8220;The essence of the coming technical jump through artificial intelligence may address some of the biological predicaments that have befallen human existence, however there may yet have to be an extra push towards globalisation, and a threat from elsewhere in the universe may be the only way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Humans are cyclical creatures revisiting the same patterns over and over again. Some cycles of behaviour may be encased in larger cycles and others are short term cycles within a small period of time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Linguistically, the natural progression has been towards the English language, therefore the global New World Order language will supersede all others, and in time the rest will fade away. The English language itself could transmute into an altogether more concise efficient form of communication where the vocabulary for the globalised world would be stripped and simplified even further.</p>
<p>&#8220;One way or another, the singular world system will be revealed within the next decade.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t know who we&#8217;re going to be shocked by any more,&#8221; Stanley Peesie, a CNN news anchor revealed solemnly.</p>
<p>On the MSN news network news readers were seen bawling their eyes out as they attempted to read the terrible news.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who am I going to chastise for wearing fur now? I just went and bought a mink coat in honour of Joan Rivers,&#8221; a visibly distraught news reader for MSNBC, Dominic Lewsanius, revealed today.</p>
<p>As the funeral cortège snaked through Manhattan Village on Friday, liberals threw pieces of stripped bacon at the procession in honour of Joan&#8217;s famously vulgar humour.</p>
<p>&#8220;She would have liked that touch. It&#8217;s good that the liberals finally came up to her level of bad taste thinking. It took a whole life time but they finally got it after she died,&#8221; Rivers&#8217;s agent told news outlets.</p>
<p>One positive thing about Joan Rivers passing is that she will not decompose for the next 400 years. Maybe by then they can bring her back to life to entertain the liberals of the future.</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t get tickets this time but can&#8217;t wait for the next Kate Bush concert when I&#8217;m 120 years old,&#8221; Gina Malloy, an avid fan told the BBC.</p>
<p>According to Kate Bush&#8217;s agent, the ethereal singer who sometimes sounds like a beached whale, will hold the concert at the same venue in 35 year increments for the next five centuries.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thirty five years is a long time for technological progress. We already have plans for Kate to either be encased in a nano particle fluid that will allow her to warble through a sound system. Perhaps in the future, concerts will be beamed into the minds of fans wherever they are geographically located. Please reserve your tickets now, you won&#8217;t be disappointed. See you there in 35 years folks,&#8221; Jasper Pointon, Kate Bush&#8217;s agent revealed yesterday.</p>

<p>Some bearded pansy twat had a tantrum on television over an ice cream in a bucket that he threw in a bin.</p>
<p>The British Bake Off episode resulted in 562 complaints to the BBC and outrage across the whole of the UK.</p>

<p>All across Britain, there was not even a mention of World War III starting, it was all talk about the British Bake Off.</p>

<p>NHS staff were however said to be relieved by the new EU restrictions on vacuum cleaners.</p>
<p>&#8220;We get them in here regularly with vacuum cleaners stuck to their privates. It&#8217;s using up valuable NHS time and money trying to get these machines off their bodies,&#8221; one doctor revealed yesterday.</p>

<p>Consider this fact that all it will take for the criminals to get around the new licence plate recognition cameras filming you every day is to find a car with the same colour, make, model as their car, and clone the number plate. Criminals have been doing it for years with penalty points and getting away with it quite successfully.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re an Eastern European over here (70% of the population of Britain) simply drive a vehicle registered in some back alley in some former Soviet bloc shite hole. Anyone from the EU who lives and works in Britain is not bound by the same laws as the rest of us prisoners. Anyone who has a vehicle registered in the EU has carte Blanche to do as they please on Britain&#8217;s roads, speeding, parking wherever they want and not paying road tax.</p>
<p>Every journey you do from now on will be meticulously tracked by the plate recognition cameras, and this is obviously a little test for the future where British citizens will have to pay to drive by the mile.</p>
<p>Thanks to the EU, Britain&#8217;s tiny narrow roads are now so overcrowded with traffic from the rest of Europe that on a good day if you get to your destination in less than four hours even though it&#8217;s three miles away is a good day.</p>
<p>Out of all the taxes, road tax is pretty useless any way, once paid by the over burdened taxpayer, it is meant to be used on the roads to fix the pot holes and maybe maintain them a little. Instead, the money from your road tax is diverted to other governmental departments, you know like the surveillance department or Whitehall Christmas party planning budget. Who the fuck knows?</p>
<p>Nevermind, soon the roads will be filled with driverless cars with the rest of the rabble, so pay your road tax like a good chappie and keep biting your lip with your mouth firmly shut and your foot pressed hard on the accelerator peddle as you steam through another checkpoint.</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>The Ice Bucket Challenge has had serious coverage but now there&#8217;s a new challenge for true celebrities.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes I don&#8217;t get enough coverage, I call in the paps when I go shopping at Whole Foods or to grab a coffee. It&#8217;s all part of the game of me, me, me. This ice bucket challenge was great though, I don&#8217;t even know why celebs were doing it but I got the call Monday to do it and called in my personal photographer, Larry,&#8221; some celebrity said on another celebrity news site.</p>
<p>But hold on for one second, here&#8217;s a new challenge for the real die hard celebrities. You want to go that extra mile for more attention this challenge will really separate the wheat from the chaff, or should we say chunks from the diarrhoea.</p>
<p>The Excrement Challenge is being rolled out all over the internet with celebs queuing to be nominated.</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard it&#8217;s for the Daily Squib newspaper, the Excrement Challenge is no pansy ice bucket challenge for wimps, this challenge is the real deal that will confirm my celebrity status forever and it&#8217;s for the Daily Squib charity, they need to be able to buy tea and biscuits in their office once in awhile,&#8221; a celebrity model who once appeared on Big Brother 23 told celebrity site Z17.</p>
<p>Nominations are cancelled for this challenge, all wonderfully useful celebrities are welcome, the more obscure you are the better because you will get more exposure. If you are top of the tabloid newsworthy table at the moment, you can increase your exposure even further and get more adulation that you crave so much. If you have the desire to be photographed every five minutes of your life, this will give you six minutes of total exposure on a constant cyclical basis.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Instructions</strong></span></p>
<p>1) Get as many people that you know to crap in a bucket. Tramps, gardeners, PR people, agents, anyone</p>
<p>2) Top up with water or urine, add a little ice if you wish to make an extra statement</p>
<p>3) Make sure you contact all the photographers and paparazzi beforehand to announce the challenge</p>
<p>4) Pour that shit over your head and smile</p>
<p>5) Enjoy the extra attention you get, congratulate yourself, you deserve to be above the rest</p>
<p>6) Read the papers, watch the news, it&#8217;s all about you, you, you. Remember contributing to charity anonymously is for losers</p>

<p>Incoming EU president, Jean-Claude Juncker&#8217;s next move is the solidification of an EU army, air force and navy.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is imperative that the Fourth Reich is unmatched in military power. This time when we invade Russia, we will do it properly.

<p>News filtering through today suggested that Suarez got drunk in the canoe on the Amazon river and fell into the water.</p>
<p>Jorgino Cafetão, a villager, was a witness to the terrible incident: &#8220;He (Suarez) was drinking from a big bottle and paddling. He was even wearing his football shirt. We cheered from the river side, and just as I was about to warn him about the&#8230;he stood up and did a moonie at us but this made the canoe rock, and he fell in head first. In these waters there are thousands of piranhas, poor bastard didn&#8217;t have a chance. The water was frothing, and afterwards the only thing we saw left was a yellow football boot floating in the river. Perhaps they were English piranhas.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Uruguayan team have still not heard the terrible news which is still being investigated by the Brazilian authorities.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stock is real cheap at the moment at shy on 17,000. Keep buying, that&#8217;s all you need to do. It&#8217;s all pension fund debt anyway, as worthless as a pork sandwich in a synagogue, but of course the Fed don&#8217;t want you to know that, shh.&#8221;</p>
<p>The analyst then went on to cite the $60 trillion debt America owes, and how that&#8217;s good for the stock market.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, $60 trillion dollars is not that much really, consider the fact that in Zimbabwe you can just about buy a loaf of bread with sixty trillion of whatever their stupid currency is.&#8221;</p>
<p>But what about that Quantitative Easing stuff?</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re stopping that soon. Why you think the DHS is stocking up on ammo? Anyway, keep buying stocks, no, I am not about to short the market, keep buying those goddamn stocks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Is the loss of Iraq anything to do with anything?</p>
<p>&#8220;Just take a look at this <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user5/imageroot/2014/06/CS%20fear%20barometer.jpg" target="_blank">fear index</a> and I must say, haven&#8217;t seen it so high in a long time, but that&#8217;s no excuse to not keep buying stocks because when the oil price reaches $800 you&#8217;ll all be walking. As for Russia, just check out gas prices in Europe this chilly winter and see who&#8217;s got who by the balls.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To prevent any further bloodshed on the streets and schools of America, it is essential that citizens give up their firearms.</p>
<p>&#8220;The globalised new world order cannot tolerate private firearms, and it is imperative that they are relieved from the hands of everyday citizens once and for all to ensure total <a href="http://dosfan.lib.uic.edu/ERC/arms/freedom_war.html" target="_blank">freedom from war</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;The world will be a much safer place without guns, and it is key to the agenda controlled by the United Nations that all sovereign countries who fall under the global UN organisation adapt to the way of peace.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must not be alarmed by the confiscation of your weapons, but if you do resist, then there may be no option but to act by securing your weapons in the name of safety.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When you fly into Baghdad, the fun starts right there. Your plane can either be hijacked or the wings shot up. You will be greeted by black acrid smoke from burning oil wells and scenes reminiscent of the apocalypse. Horror fans will witness all manner of atrocities, and if you have VIP tickets you can even be part of the action too,&#8221; Brad Zweisher, operations director of the Iraq Jihad theme park told CNN.</p>
<p>The Iraq Jihad Wonderland theme park stretches thousands of miles even into neighbouring Syria so theme park revellers will not be pushed for choice of entertainment.</p>
<p>Budd Neuberger, 45, a salesman from Detroit bought one of the first tickets last week and is keen to go to Iraq for a once in a lifetime trip.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t wait. As soon as we land we&#8217;re in the theme park. I&#8217;m ready for a ride of a lifetime. I&#8217;m not sure what the man said when he mentioned that it was a one way trip, but as long as I have fun, who cares? I got my blind fold ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>The first plane load of 350 American theme park enthusiasts leaves on Tuesday and will be accompanied by theme park designers, George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Tony Blair and Donald Rumsfeld on the historic first one way trip.</p>

<p>Naturally the Daily Squib was always in the know about such things, and the warnings kept coming and coming, but who reads this newspaper? Certainly not some hypnotised low-information American brainwashed zombie.</p>
<p>For America&#8217;s enemies, and there are many of those, Obama has been a true blessing, he has done more damage internally than any terror cell could ever wish for. His total disdain for America has been all encompassing, and as the country daily veers towards the precipice, Obama is seen grinning from his parapet, still adored by legions of brainwashed followers who would gladly follow his orders to jump off a cliff without batting an eyelid. Obama&#8217;s demagogue status, can be easily compared to Adolf Hitler&#8217;s and this is why he was put in power by those who want to fracture the nation and guide it to complete destruction. The American experiment was over a long time ago, and Obama was the final cherry on the cake, okay, a glazed cherry laced with arsenic and snake venom.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">As the tuberculosis ridden Mexicans stream over the open borders, this message alone should be enough for the people, but still they do not get it.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Obama may very well be America&#8217;s last president, because his executive actions denote a nation that has paid the piper, and as the last ebbing throes of a very sick, fractured nation pulse through the controlled news networks, there will eventually be an explosion when the fooled people finally wake up.</span></p>
<p>But that is what the fatherless Obama wanted all along, he wanted a reaction, and whatever indignity he foisted on the American brainwashed pulp mass, he did not get anything. Sure, they&#8217;re prepared, they have the bullets, and the stockpiles, they have the FEMA camps ready with stacks of plastic coffins. They just need you to make the first move, so they can be justified in their reaction.</p>
<p>The enlightened few, are exactly that. They are not many, but they control with efficient technique the slave taxpayer, and as the debt goes over a threshold there is no turning back for America. Even if all Americans were to give every single cent from their pay checks to the government for the next fifty years, the interest payments for the debt would not be dented.</p>
<p>How Obama will laugh, as he is escorted into his bunker, his family following behind, and he will even play golf down there, sipping his patented Kool Aid whilst protected from what is going on above.</p>
<p>However long it takes, they will eventually emerge from their luxurious stasis, and build their Elysium over the bones and plastic bags of a previous civilisation that was not needed any more.</p>
<p>Obama is laughing at you right now, he always was laughing, you just didn&#8217;t know it, until it was too late.</p>

<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/7771-think-tank-core-britain-race-concentric.html">Think Tank: The Core of Britain is Race Concentric</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk">Daily Squib</a>.</p>
]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>Anyone who claims that Britain&#8217;s core is not racially concentrated is deluded says a new think tank paper.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite simply put, there is a very good reason why there has never been a person of dark skin tone as Prime Minister of Britain, because the core institutions within this nation follow a rigid racial lineage. The same applies to British entertainment, advertising and commerce.</p>
<p>&#8220;The emergence of political parties like Ukip simply mirror what the core English population believes. The socialist left may pretend to not be racial however, one only has to look at their former leaders and you will not see a dark face in sight. The Conservatives, may have a few tokens here or there as MPs, however their roots lie not only amongst class lines but racial lines. The armed forces and Intelligence services are all geared to preserving the core racial lineage and there has never been a dark person in charge, as is the case in the police services.</p>
<p>&#8220;As for London, which is now a multi-racial cooking pot, possibly going into a boil, if one looks at history, one will see that London has always been a magnet for the whole world to congregate, but tensions are rising daily as the English feel disenfranchised in their own capital city and White Flight occurs. Queen Elizabeth I even had a few words to say about the influx in 1596, her majesty issued an “open letter” to the Lord Mayor of London, announcing that “there are of late divers black- moores brought into this realme, of which kinde of people there are allready here to manie,” and ordering that they be deported from the country. One week later, she reiterated her “good pleasure to have those kinde of people sent out of the lande” Finally, in 1601, she complained again about the “great numbers of Negars and Blackamoors which (as she is informed) are crept into this realm,” defamed them as “infidels, having no understanding of Christ or his Gospel,” and, one last time, authorized their deportation. It is true to say therefore that London has always been a contentious part of the country for the English.</p>
<p>&#8220;The influx of white Eastern Europeans into the country will be congratulated by many Britons in the future, as not only are most of them white, but they are Christian and deeply racist. This is a vast difference to previous influxes of former Commonwealth populations, and of course Third World nations, who are mostly viewed as untermenschen by the core English populations.</p>
<p>&#8220;To have someone like Sajid Javid claim that he has passed the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/10838579/I-would-pass-the-Tebbit-test-says-Sajid-Javid.html" target="_blank">Tebbit</a> test is in itself ridiculous. First of all, he may presume to be integrated and tick all the boxes, but the core English population will never see him as one of them simply because of his skin colour and his name.</p>
<p>&#8220;The United Kingdom is ruled by the British Royal family, whose bloodline is linked directly to the Saxe-Coburg-Gotha and House of Hanover. The point being made here is that the British royal family is Germanic and of course even though they are imports, they are still racially pure and white. Therefore, the core of Britain is racially Aryan. To have a kingdom, otherwise would be deemed as madness for the British. You cannot ever be English if you are non white, that is the core of England.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ukip will win the upcoming Euro elections by a landslide despite the torrent of smears from the other scared political parties. This is simply a symptom of the core English public fighting back. They seem to have bitten their stiff upper lips for far too long, and now they&#8217;re shouting. It is presumed that Lenny Henry will not be voting, tis a shame because he tried so hard to be English but failed miserably.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s no secret that we would so, so much want to do the same in Britain, but it would sort of go against all the laws we have here in this country. Maybe we could rustle up a few changes to the law in the next parliament session,&#8221; an admiring Conservative MP for Bridleswaide, Arthur Cone, told the BBC.</p>
<p>The photograph of a Turkish politician kicking a downed flailing voter was shown in parliament yesterday, and the sounds of admiration emanating from the British MPs confirmed to news crews that such behaviour is truly desired and respected.</p>
<p>Well, come the next election, quite a lot of MPs will themselves get a good kicking, in the UK and most probably in dictatorial Turkey.</p>

<p>&#8220;First of all, there is no one else to blame but the agencies who are collecting data from citizens irrespective of their status. Secondly, these agencies were to blame for allowing the leak to take place in the first instance. Don&#8217;t you vet your operatives? Aren&#8217;t there controls in place for your secretive work? Therefore, we come to the conclusion that the necessary precautions by the intelligence agencies were not adhered to in the proper manner, and the blame firmly falls on them,&#8221; some senior researcher revealed in a recent report.</p>
<p>&#8220;The blame should not be on Snowden&#8217;s shoulders for revealing that every citizen is tracked, their data logged and their private conversations recorded. If one is to analyse the current global situation, one would see that Snowden&#8217;s deed actually sped up whatever plan is in place. This makes us come to an alternative conclusion, maybe Snowden was part of the plan all along. Remember that war is a wonderful opportunity to exact plans quickly, plans that may have taken decades to come into fruition. The Hegelian Dialectic at work, wherein the chaos is engineered and out of that, a solution is unveiled. We shall have to see what is in store, but presumably it will involve an economic depression so deep that civil unrest will ensue, and people will beg with open arms for salvation from their misery &#8212; cue the solution.&#8221;</p>

<p>Halal eggs are used in pretty much everything from your mayo to the chocolate cake you stuffed into your salivating mouth yesterday.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had an omelette this morning and then whilst on the train proceeded to read my copy of the Daily Mail. To say I was horrified at what I read would be an understatement. I realised that my omelette was made from halal eggs. I immediately stuck two fingers down my throat and vomited over the person next to me on the morning commute from Oxford,&#8221; Reggie Sanders, 56, a company director, told the Evening Standard.</p>
<p>Halal eggs are created by chickens who lay eggs in the Islamic fashion. They are first blessed by an Imam, then they are told to submit to God whilst laying their eggs. Factory farms across the UK all have resident Islamic priests who recite the Koran to chickens before they lay their eggs. The chickens also have to face Mecca and if they refuse are sent to be slaughtered, in the halal way of course.</p>
<p>This begs the question, what about Easter Eggs? Well, you think they&#8217;re Christian eggs, but they&#8217;re actually halal eggs squirted ritually from the bottoms of hens and painted like Easter eggs.</p>
<p>Nigel Farage of Ukip has vowed to  ensure all eggs in the UK are Ukip eggs when he wins the next election, seeing as he was unceremoniously yoked by a deadly halal egg on a recent walkabout.</p>

<p>&#8220;They hugged each other even though there was a rather unsightly knife still sticking out of Dave&#8217;s back. I don&#8217;t know how he managed to sit in economy with that thing lodged firmly between his shoulder blades. He looked slightly drained, mind you,&#8221; an airport worker told the BBC.</p>
<p>David, will be staying in Ed&#8217;s spare room for his two week holiday, where he will assist in the big Labour campaign.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters Ed Miliband was happy that his brother had put any animosity behind him and chose to support him to election victory.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad my brother has come back from exile for a few weeks. The knife is still firmly lodged in his back, but I told him it was all for the good of the party. This is how I will run the country when I become prime minister. You will listen to my whiny nasal voice from loudspeakers everywhere, and I will remind you what a ruthless git I am on a daily basis by bringing out a new law every thirty seconds inhibiting your freedoms further. Now good day, and fuck off. I&#8217;m taking my brother to a Labour meeting where I can parade him and his stabbed back around to the party elders and show &#8216;em my handiwork.&#8221;</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Writing in the Business Illuminus paper published quarterly, maybe it&#8217;s time to get suited and booted before the whole shit house goes up in flames.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eighty-five billion &#8211; at best an unorthodox number to start a countdown, but perhaps the disruption of the time-honoured 10, 9, 8… was well overdue. Whatever the case, next month the US Federal Reserve is already expected to announce number thirty-five billion. In response to post-recession economic stagnation, each month of last year the Fed pumped $85 billion into the US economy via its quantitative easing (QE) program. In December the Fed cut its monthly asset purchases to $75 billion, and has been gradually tapering ever since. In fact by the end of the year we should get to zero &#8211; how very exciting &#8211; and then what? Well you don’t have to be prescient to know that there are only two possible outcomes:</p>
<p>&#8220;<strong>Outcome I</strong> – Over the summer, bankers decide to celebrate with some good old-fashioned frivolous lending, and why not? They are backed by a few trillion Dollars in QE generated reserves at the Fed. They remember the euphoria of lending, the unabated energy and the incredible confidence that it inspires. Banks go on a lending binge leveraging their Fed reserves. Suddenly there is so much money in the system that the Dollar is worthless. Hyperinflation sweeps through the nation, and the Dollar to Euro exchange rate settles at 4.2 trillion to one. Civil unrest forces a radical regime change, which spawns a global conflict, and finally results in World War III. Only the drones survive WWIII.</p>
<p>&#8220;<strong>Outcome II</strong> &#8211; The end of the year comes too soon taking liquidity with it. The Fed underestimates the weakness of the labour market, and overestimates economic growth. We hit zero, and dejectedly wave goodbye to QE. Money dries up, including welfare resources that are long gone. The lack of consumer spending causes businesses to slash wages of the fortunate few, and lay off the rest. Unemployment skyrockets to 27%, and the US becomes a nation of nomads traversing the country on rumours of jobs. The sanitation system breaks down precipitating the pervasive spread of a new disease. Those infected mutate into zombies with an insatiable hunger. Movie stars remain just that, no vaccine is discovered, and we finally have a zombie apocalypse.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can be so sure of one of these occurring because someone has to be right and someone has to be wrong.  The great recession brought us much debate about economic policy &#8211; i.e, government intervention versus letting the free market take care of itself. So now the only redeeming factor about the end of the world is that we will finally know who was right. For a brief moment in time either the free market champions or the interventionists will enjoy incontrovertible validation. As the drone flies by the window free marketers can happily go into the light knowing the government helped too much. Alternatively interventionists can alleviate the pain of a zombie bite with the knowledge that the government didn’t help enough. Not a bad consolation prize.</p>
<p>&#8220;Speaking hypothetically now if by some chance the world does not end, the only thing we can be certain about is that each party will interpret any economic stability as a justification for its economic philosophy. Post QE the free market folks will aver that we would be in a much better position had the markets decided our fate, and the interventionists will boldly claim that with a bit more help we would be flying.</p>
<p>&#8220;With rumours of Chinese property bubbles, and the unrest in Ukraine as Russia eyes incursions further into Europe, the augurs do not bode well for a world economy addicted to fake money and consumers still drunk on credit. Are you prepared for the zombie apocalypse in a zombie global economy?</p>
<p>&#8220;If you have any money left now &#8212; start spending.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This winter, in what remains of the Ukraine, you better be dug in real good with a fire constantly on the go, because there won&#8217;t be any gas from Russia coming any time soon,&#8221; a Russian oil and gas contractor told RT news today.</p>
<p>What about Britain and the rest of Europe? Well, let&#8217;s say if you think your gas bill is high now, prepare for next winter when prices rise by 6,000%. Soon we&#8217;ll be burning wood from our bannisters to keep warm. Hope you don&#8217;t forget the imminent interest rate rises to spice things up even further.</p>
<p>Who&#8217;s to thank for this debacle? Well, if the US and EU hadn&#8217;t caused a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkC4Z67QuC0&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">coup d&#8217;état</a> in Kiev for their own expansionist reasons, we wouldn&#8217;t be on the brink of war right now.</p>

<p>The calls are out there now to bring back Donald Rumsfeld, because at least he knew the known unknowns.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we bring back Rummy he could put the Russians back in their place. These libs couldn&#8217;t fight themselves out of a paper bag. Look at the mess they&#8217;ve created, or maybe that&#8217;s what they want huh. At least with the neo cons you knew you were in a constant state of war and people accepted their false flags graciously, the <em>dems</em> are just too erratic and have <em>pussified</em> everyone so no one knows what&#8217;s going on any more,&#8221; an uninformed Capitol Hill insider revealed Thursday.</p>
<p>How utterly embarrassing this all is..but, let&#8217;s face it, governments have been doing this underhand stuff for centuries, false flag attacks are an accepted policy within the right circles and the chaos that is occurring globally now is a sign that president Obama is doing his job right. This was his job, and he is positively moving mountains, making the herds scatter, increasing fear, paranoia, terror, and ultimately war.</p>

<p>&#8220;We learned this technique many years ago from a certain someone with a dodgy moustache. What the Americans already do is put a by-product of the fertilizer industry into the water, so that these poisons benefit the population. We want to do the same in the UK now, so you can drink and wash in a lovely soup of <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/10722075/Government-study-backs-fluoride-in-water.html" target="_blank">fluoride</a> and <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-105466/Fertility-timebomb-drinking-water.html" target="_blank">oestrogen</a> every day. Do part your man boobs and listen, there is a reason why the male fertility rate is dropping at an increased rate, IQ levels are dropping and cancer rates are sky rocketing,&#8221; a Westminster insider revealed.</p>
<p>Fluorides are general protoplasmic poisons, probably because of their capacity to modify the metabolism of cells by changing the permeability of the cell membrane and by inhibiting certain enzyme systems, but don&#8217;t let that bother you when you have a nice cool glass of refreshing water.</p>
<p>Fluoridated water will also be utilised in food, ice cream and pretty much everything you consume. Enjoy!</p>

]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>Back in 2012 the Daily Squib <a href="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/3459-next-european-fascist-leader-waiting-in-wings-as-euro-crisis-deepens.html" target="_blank">predicted</a> in its own way that the EU was a catalyst for the re-emergence of European <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/24/marine-le-pen-national-front-stronger-disillusion-french-elections" target="_blank">fascism</a>, in one form or another.</p>
<p>Through the billowing smoke of incompetence, corruption and idiocy of the European Union, there now rises a tangible fascistic threat to the current EU debacle.</p>
<p>Fascism is something that never went away from Europe, and there is a growing tide of discontent against the forced multiculturalism being pushed down the throats of the whites within the continent. The EU already incorporates an amalgamation of fascism and soviet ideologies, however pure fascism, as in the racial form could be a threat initially to the EU, but once it is dissolved, ethnic fascism would reconvene the states, as one cohesive unit, albeit without the non-whites.</p>
<p>&#8220;In any area of town, if anyone who has colour moves in, we move out. This is the way it has always been and will always be. The French are notoriously racist, and <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/24/marine-le-pen-national-front-stronger-disillusion-french-elections" target="_blank">Le Pen</a> is a reaction to the influx of African and Algerian immigration, who breed like rats and are a burden on French society. Fascism thrives when there is an element of threat, to spur on the white masses. They must feel as if they are in constant danger and a good leader will ensure he/she will keep on stoking the fires until a raging storm builds up,&#8221; a fascist Le Pen supporter revealed.</p>
<p>There are of course elements of the Hegelian Dialectic at work as well, deep down, the majority of whites detest any other skin colour, and it is this biological programming that allows fascism to flourish, as the supposed opposition wills it into place through forced multiculturalism.</p>
<p>The fasci rods are all too prevalent in the UK as the rise of the English national parties grow stronger every day. Mass immigration was allowed to happen for a reason, to create discontent and calls for a solution. If you overcrowd the indigenous population with foreigners, then you create hatred. This is what they want, they want the people to demand a solution, and they will be presented with one soon enough.</p>
<p>Looking from the outside inward, Martin Amis understands full well, that the English core is one of skin colour. He states astutely that <em>darkies</em> can never be English, and this is the defining point about <em>Englishness</em>. You may be well spoken, well educated or talented, even born in the UK, but you&#8217;re not English, and never will be. But what of the Poles, and other white Eastern Europeans who have come over to the UK in the most recent EU migratory push? Well, they may talk sort of funny, have weird names, but they will supersede the <em>darkies</em>, because not only are they white, but they&#8217;re Christian. They will be English one day. This is a fundamental point to make, they will supersede the immigration from the 1950s &#8211; 80s, which included many dark skinned people from the Commonwealth countries. Those immigrants into the UK, from the 50s &#8211; 80s will never be accepted into the English heartland, and are classed as untermenschen.</p>
<p>Therefore, we come to the crux of the matter. The rise of fascism in Europe is down to one very simple element, and that is the fact that what ever happens, if you have a non-white skin tone, which is something you were born with and cannot control, you are a lesser human being in the eyes of a fascist.</p>
<p>Soon the day may come when the soldiers come door to door, they will take the coloured occupants from their houses and march them down the streets all the while, the silent curtains twitching with relief.</p>

<p>The beleaguered president then went on another one of his rants: &#8220;They be spying on Finklestein, Carter, Biden and Michelle. Hell, they even spied on my pet dawg, whassisname? Ah, never mind, listen I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going on, I get orders, you know memos about what I gotta say every day, they then tell me to show up some place, read off a teleprompter, then go back to some big ol&#8217; house painted all white n sheeit. You think I asked for all this aggro? Then I got Zuckerburger on one line, Netanyahoo on the other, and who&#8217;s that other ass clown, oh yeah, Putin on hold. What you think I am, Superman? I&#8217;m just some guy from Kenya who got lucky. NSA is above the law, they can lie to Congress and do whatever they want, and if they don&#8217;t like you, well let&#8217;s say they can press the delete button whenever they want.

<p>&#8220;With debt obligations in excess of <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w19253" target="_blank">$70 trillion</a> in 2012, can the US play economic games with Russia? After all, there is a self sufficiency to the Russians, they are used to hardship and toil, the Americans on the other hand are not used to scrimping and saving, they simply spend and spend even more.</p>
<p>&#8220;The cracks will eventually widen as the Russkies dig in, whereas the Yanks, who are addicted to their profligacy and over indulgence in all matters will simply spend more money that they do not have thus digging an even bigger debt hole for themselves.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is of course an element of good cop bad cop with the current brinkmanship being displayed, as in reality, Obama and Putin are keen followers of the same Marxist policies. This is simply a game, and since Americans feel they have scattered the contrived Islamic threat some what, there is a hunger to find a new enemy for the plebs to wave their jingoist flags and bay at.</p>
<p>&#8220;The economic war has been going on for some time, way before any Ukrainian excursion, however as things escalate, the main target will probably be the dollar.</p>
<p>&#8220;By simply putting a spanner in the cogs, Russia could destabilise the dollar initially making it rise to unheard of heights, then slapping it down to nothing. Many countries have been slowly unloading, and the dollar is not safe any more as a world currency. The dollar is key to global stability, but more importantly, it is crucial for Americans, purely as a fiat currency, this is why things are so cheap in the U.S. if that were to go, then the Americans would be paying inflated prices for goods that the rest of the world is forced to pay.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is interesting that whenever Obama utters a word, he makes sure he iterates the point that it is the rest of the world against Russia. America is not the &#8216;rest of the world&#8217; they may think they are, but they are not any more, and it is this arrogance, and insular ignorance which will be their final undoing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Madonna has been cultivating snails under her arm pits for some time now, she has a penchant for such delicacies, and enjoys the feeling of companionship only a snail can give.</p>
<p>&#8220;I love the crunching sound when I lower my arm. These snails feed off my arm pit hair and the little critters that live there. They do tend to grow quite large, possibly due to the extra nutrients I give them,&#8221; Madonna said at New York&#8217;s premier French restaurant, Chez Salope.</p>
<p>The four Michelin starred restaurant also pays top dollar for the escargot, not only for the star factor of the grande dame of pop, but the sheer size of these bags of slimy puss.</p>
<p>Head chef, Gerard Draino, revealed: &#8220;Madonna&#8217;s escargot is delightful, they are succulent and have an amazing aroma. Our patrons naturally pay through the nose, and we&#8217;re not talking snot, but oodles of cash to eat a Madonna escargot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As we all know Michael Gove is a much loved individual nationally and we are at a loss as to how and why this kidnapping could have occurred. Hopefully he will not be tortured whilst in captivity, or have his head dunked in a bucket of dog mess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Many of my patients live in abject fear of climate change, as it is pumped incessantly through the media networks day in day out. I tell them, if you are having a heart attack to not worry about climate change, and funnily enough they tell me they feel a lot better about it after that,&#8221; Dr. Hardy told the Boston Medical Journal.</p>
<p>One of the doctor&#8217;s patients, Auguste Balls, who is so worried about climate change that he has had three heart attacks in succession, has revealed his trick to stop thinking about climate change.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t turn on the news any more or read the papers or the internet. If I go somewhere and hear a radio on, or television, I immediately leave that area. It&#8217;s the only way I can stop the climate change reports. Funnily enough, when I was having a heart attack, that was the only time I stopped thinking about climate change. We gotta pay for the humans, we gotta pay for the climate change, more taxes, green taxes, its the humans&#8217; fault, we gotta pay carbon taxes, aargh, we gotta pay surcharge green taxes on airplanes, we gotta pay green taxes on our gas&#8230;I, I&#8217;m having another meltdown..gaaaaaaah!!!&#8221;</p>
<p>Sadly Mr Balls passed away shortly after speaking about climate change on CNN.</p>

<p>Please do not bother yourself with worrisome geopolitical matters, carry on with your inane bubble life. You will not need to stockpile food, prepare for a banking collapse or any other serious things like survival.</p>
<p>1) Please carry on surfing your Facebook page with your vacuous friends and at all costs do not think about the Ukraine and the invasion by Russia. Post more pictures of the meal you had, or better still more pictures of your kids, you are a great parent and you need to affirm this by posting pictures of every achievement they do. Oh, you&#8217;ve got a friend you don&#8217;t agree with have you? Well, it&#8217;s simple just delete them and they&#8217;re gone.</p>
<p>2) You must watch the latest episode of Come Dancing. This is so much more important than all out war, I wonder who is going to get thrown out this time?</p>
<p>3) Have you got the latest smartphone app, it&#8217;s out on android and iphone, you need to download this app and play the game for hours. If you do happen to hear any air raid sirens, simply get under your bed covers and continue playing. Don&#8217;t forget to take a selfie when the bomb drops.</p>
<p>4) Ah, you&#8217;ve just noticed the price of petrol has increased by 35%, as have all utilities and food prices. Do not worry yourself with such trivialities, just carry on with the latest episode of Big Brother or other reality show. Don&#8217;t forget to phone in to vote for your favourite contestant and naturally you have to be so engrossed in the show that you must talk about it at every opportunity.</p>
<p>5) Have you got the latest fashionable outfit? Well, this is very important. You must spend all your money on looking your best and be in with the in crowd. If you don&#8217;t do this you are unfashionable, and that&#8217;s verging on criminality, besides you have to look your best for that special supermarket trip where you can look at all the empty shelves on display.</p>
<p>6) What&#8217;s that celebrity doing? This is very important, you must read about celebrity x who has just thrown a tissue on the pavement and not bothered to pick it up. You must comment on it on entertainment sites and make it your life&#8217;s mission to follow inconsequential banal drippings from the entertainment section or you will be left behind in everyday conversation. Ideally, the right hand side of the Daily Mail should be your primary reading list, forget about everything else.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m thinking of taking another taxpayer vacation, but before I do that, I want to extend my gratitude to Vladimir Putin for showing what a weak leader I am with no idea about foreign policy, I&#8217;m cordially inviting him to sign up to Obamacare. All he needs to do is sign in on the website if it&#8217;s up.</p>
<p>&#8220;If there is actual shooting with guns going on in the Ukraine, I may even send in some of those gay marines I appointed to quell the major war that&#8217;s about to happen. I successfully emasculated the U.S. army last year with the introduction of mandatory homosexual battalions on active duty.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t really agree with guns so I think we&#8217;ll pass on this kind of stuff. Ooh, look at this, I just got a message through that <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2014/02/28/iran-nuclear-economic-advance/5835935/" target="_blank">Iran</a> is pushing ahead with their nuclear weapons program.

<p>One of the judges for the skiing competition, Igor Rasputinski revealed the racy details: &#8220;It was a gorgeous day, the sun streamed through the trees warming us. I was on the top of the slope and Olga, a very beautiful skier who was about to race, bent down to check her ski boots, when she looked up again she must have caught the eye of this fantastic looking Austrian girl. They immediately said a few words before they enjoyed a very sensual French kiss which went on for six minutes thirty two seconds, I was timing it. They looked in each other&#8217;s eyes again, then Olga went down the slope joined later by Andrea the other skier. I had to go and have a long cold shower afterwards, not out of my choice but because there is no hot water in the hotel showers in Sochi.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two skiers went on to win joint gold medals and were cheered by the joyous crowd.</p>

<p>&#8220;Manufacturing had a massive increase of 0.00001% and retail sales are up a whopping 0.0000002%. These figures are remarkable you cannot deny. Coupled with house price rises because we let in half the population of the world, it&#8217;s all hunky dory my oik friends. I know you&#8217;re all living off the credit cards now to pay everyday bills, and subsisting on pot noodles, but look on the bright side, this great depression is going to reach a new phase soon and your daily miserable existence may be alleviated when the whole bloody lot comes crashing down. Oops, did I let the cat out of the bag too soon, please forgive me and carry on as normal, do keep watching your reality shows and surfing the Facebook.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Chancellor then went on to announce more tax increases for everyone and an extra bonus for welfare recipients who will enjoy further cuts effective immediately.</p>
<p>Labour shadow Chancellor, Ed Balls was quick to jump in rebuking Osborne.</p>
<p>&#8220;If it wasn&#8217;t for us the Tories would not be in this mess, and I can therefore count on all your votes so that we can borrow even more money to imprison generations to come in even further debt when you vote us back in in 2015. You, Osborne are an irresponsible maniac for your treacherous electioneering economic trickery. Excuse me, I&#8217;ve got a piano lesson to go to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a very good reason why unintelligent people are made famous either as useless celebrities or sub-par pop outfits. Firstly, in the fickle society we inhabit, intelligence or talent is not valued in the entertainment industry, instead a good cheek bone structure or nose will do the job. You can be practically brain dead, but as long as you have the look, you will be famous.</p>
<p>&#8220;Secondly, dumb people are easier to control by the clever people behind the scenes. The stupid moronic idiots that are being peddled like performing monkeys do get a piece of the money pie, but only a small percentage of what their handlers are getting. In the entertainment industry, it would be detrimental to have a performer who was self aware and intelligent with knowledge of how they are being exploited. This is why clever people cannot be performing monkeys. That role is best left to the dumb, narcissistic, egotistical morons.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once a performer has outlived his/her usefulness, they are usually dumped by their handlers. This usually then results in the performer going off the rails. Maybe there is an element of realisation for them that they were used, but mostly it is an attention seeking exercise. Additional factors contributing to the downfall include loss of expert guidance by their intelligent handlers. Stupid performing animals need to be told exactly what to do at all times, once that&#8217;s gone, then the facade they were projecting is lifted. If the celebrity or pop tart dies, then the managing party will have the opportunity to cream off even more money from post mortem sales and documentaries as well as merchandise.</p>
<p>&#8220;In today&#8217;s entertainment business why are stupid people valued so much compared to other eras? Well, the dumbing down of the youth is a key agenda and for the most part it has been a very useful tool for those who rule. Populations have seen intelligence quotas drop drastically as the dumbed down generations breed bringing even more dumb people into the world to be exploited.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is of no use to have people who are intelligent, they must be dumbed down even further. We now have an increasing number of stupid performers performing to stupid audiences. Cha Ching!&#8221;</p>

<p>The advent of driverless trains will ensure that tube drivers who are receiving over £60,000 per annum will be phased out by cheaper more efficient automated driving systems, and the same goes for Bob Crow who makes over £450,000 per annum for pretty much doing nothing. Underground ticket prices will therefore drop drastically once the cost cutting benefits occur.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can announce today that by 2017 I will be replaced by an algorithm that will function in an economical way. There will be no more useless tube drivers or crippling tedious strikes ever again. I will be sad to see my very expensive luxury holidays go, my champagne and caviare slap up meals in Claridges, and my ridiculously opulent unlimited expense account reduced to a mere dust bitten memory. But there you go, that&#8217;s progress I guess. I think I&#8217;m going to go on another holiday funded by you to protest at this injustice,&#8221; Comrade Crow told the London Evening Standard.</p>
<p>According to computer experts, the program that will replace Bob Crow will still be a complete arsehole, but a manageable one, so that&#8217;s okay then. Roll on 2017.</p>

Welcome to America's first Socialist theme park.</p><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/6324-americans-open-new-socialism-theme-park.html">Americans Open New Socialism Theme Park</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk">Daily Squib</a>.</p>]]></description><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Built in America&#8217;s heartland the American Socialism Theme Park welcomes all Americans for fun filled sombre times.</p>
<p>The desolate socialist landscape extends over America, and ever since Barack Obama came into power, the effects of socialism have seen a drastic reduction in the quality of life for the everyday American; this has been meticulously reproduced in the newly built &#8216;Socialism Theme Park&#8217; situated just a short ride from I-94, fifth exit, northbound.</p>
<p>The socialist theme park&#8217;s warden, Karl Jenkem explains what attendees can expect when taking the whole family to the theme park:</p>
<p>&#8220;When you walk through the gates of the Socialism Theme Park, you are immediately told to empty all the money and any items of value you may have on your person into a black plastic bag by a man wearing an Obama clown mask. These items are then kept never to be seen again. Revellers are then told to undress completely, given special theme park uniforms and ordered to join a massive queue stretching for miles. Once they get to the front of that queue they are told to join another queue which is even longer. Do not be alarmed, there is one Obamacare doctor per 40,000 theme park attendees, so if you faint or fall down during the queuing session which may take days, you will be taken to a makeshift tent and refused medicine because it&#8217;s too expensive. If you have any complaints, you will be issued a free Obamaphone where you can protest as much as you want, but there will be no answer at the end of the line.</p>
<p>&#8220;Throughout the extended queuing process masked &#8216;Knockout&#8217; gangs of young people will be deployed to randomly knock out any theme park attendee that either doesn&#8217;t look right, isn&#8217;t paying attention or looks weaker than anyone else. Beware, the thugs patrol in gangs and can appear out of nowhere moving swiftly, preferring to strike from the back when you are most vulnerable.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you get to the end of the second queue alive you will be shoved forcefully down a water slide at the bottom of which you will be told to sign away any pension, shares, bank account or property you own. You will then be taken into a dark room where there will be a sparse single light bulb. TSA officials will then give you a full internal body search and tell you that it is for your own good.</p>
<p>&#8220;During the exciting theme park adventure, people will be promised a job so they can feed their families. This will of course never materialise but hope is one of the many features of your time at the camp, ahem, I mean theme park. Please do not try to escape Socialism Theme Park at any time as the park&#8217;s perimeter is not only patrolled by attack dogs and armed guards, but autonomous killer drones from the air that can deploy missiles to blow you into tiny little charred pieces.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two henchmen will then appear out of another door, grab you forcefully and dump you into an even darker room with a powerful spotlight directed at your face. An NSA interrogator will appear from another door. He will tell you all about your internet surfing history, social networking data, smartphone conversations, financial transactions, what type of toothpaste you use and every minute detail of your life. He will then interrogate you to see if he can extract any more information from you that you may have held back. You will not be able to see the face of the goon interrogating you, but be warned, if you have any objections, you could be detained indefinitely in another Obamacare Education Center at an undisclosed location.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the third dark room you will be put in front of a screen and told to watch a gun re-education video. If you refuse to watch this, a woman with a Feinstein mask will appear from a secret door and start shrieking like a banshee, she will then put a gun to your head with a single bullet in the cylinder. She will spin the cylinder, then shout at you to pull the trigger. If you survive this ordeal, you will be told to renounce guns and taken to another room. If you choose to still refuse to renounce guns, you will be handed back the gun for continued Russian roulette sessions until the gun finally goes off.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you survive the third room, you will then be taken to a medical Obamacare area to have a tracking chip placed under your skin and you will be given a number. You will then hear an announcement: &#8216;Your time at America&#8217;s Socialism Theme Park is nearly over, we hope you have enjoyed your stay here, please exit from one of three doors, choose wisely&#8217;. What the theme park attendee will not know is that all three doors lead to one place, yes you&#8217;ve guessed it, a FEMA camp, a place which you will never leave &#8212; alive.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Entry to the new theme park is free for all Americans. The park will be officially opened in March 2014. Please bring the whole family for fun times.</em></p>

The canvas was propped up on the wall, and the artist daubed red emulsion paint over the previously white canvas turning it red.</p>
<p>&#8220;I used red paint to cover the canvas surface completely. The painting took 48 minutes to do. I particularly took care to not let any droplets fall to the ground. I have transformed the previously white canvas to red,&#8221; Eduardo Mancini, the celebrated artist revealed in Art magazine.</p>
<p>The painting has already been snapped up the Gogassian gallery in New York and is estimated to sell for $850,000 with a few collectors vying to buy the piece in a bidding war.</p>
<p>Angus McFenster, 45, a carpenter from East Kilbride, Scotland has emulated the same style of painting but was less lucky with collectors.</p>
<p>&#8220;I went to a gallery with a similar painting of the art piece sold in New York but in blue. They asked me what my name was, when I replied &#8216;Angus McFenster&#8217; they said &#8216;who?&#8217;. I suppose if you don&#8217;t have a name you can&#8217;t get away with it. Sold it at a car boot sale for a fiver.&#8221;</p>

Don&#8217;t bother yourself with such twaddle, simply follow some of these tips and you won&#8217;t ever have to pay for motor insurance again in your life.</p>
<p>1) Have your vehicle registered in either the EU or anywhere else outside the UK. You won&#8217;t need car insurance or be liable for any penalty points ever again.</p>
<p>2) Drive a stolen car. Naturally, we do not condone such actions but no insurance will be needed for this, although if you&#8217;re caught by one of the millions of traffic cams around you could be in the shit.</p>
<p>3) If you have a car, sell it immediately. You will never have to pay for car insurance again, no more road tax, MOT, insane fuel prices or rip off repair costs. As of yet walking or taking public transport does not need a licence, but things could change any day as the hard up government and greedy corporations seek even more ways of fleecing the public.</p>
<p>4) Get a scrap piece of paper, draw a few pretty pictures on it, then scribble the words &#8216;car insurance&#8217; on the top. Voila, you now are insured. You can add as many years of motor insurance as you wish. If you&#8217;re stopped by the rozzers simply hand over the document, and don&#8217;t forget to smile.</p>
<p>5) Become a member of the royal family, high ranking member of parliament, secret service, celebrity chef, BBC hierarchy or anyone else deemed important. You will never have to pay for anything ever again, let alone poxy car insurance.</p>

As the <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2531159/Antarctic-crew-build-ice-helipad-help-rescuers.html" target="_blank">global warming scientists</a> are still stuck in the ice and the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/antarctica/10548690/Antarctic-rescue-ship-now-stuck-in-ice.html" target="_blank">rescue ship</a> is stuck as well, you may be getting second thoughts about that freezing global warming thing.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t like to ring our own bell here at the Squib (right) but we kind of knew it was a <a href="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/2142-global-warming-scientist-freezes-to-death.html" target="_blank">global warming scam</a> a while back but that&#8217;s just the thing with satire, is it true or false, did it make you think, does it look into the future? If so, then we did our job unlike the regular news which feeds you controlled propaganda day in day out.</p>
<p>Well, as promised, here&#8217;s how to warm yourself during the freezing global warming we&#8217;re having now.</p>
<p>Warm yourself with the thought that global warming was a big scam to create eco taxes. It was not created by scientists but its creation was conjured up by some society or other to make you feel bad for reproducing, for being human and polluting the world with your existence. Along with carbon taxes, huge increases in eco taxes and of course how could we forget the Al Gore film that made him a stonking $300 million, global warming was an amazing money maker. As for the suckers who fell for it, you fall for everything else so global warming was just another progression. Voting for Obama &#8211;twice. Now that&#8217;s dumb. You get what you vote for, as the saying goes.</p>
<p>Naturally the earth&#8217;s climate does change over millions of years, and there has been some impact from human intervention, but don&#8217;t forget, the people who made those factories and plundered the earth are the ones who want to eco tax the populace now saying it is their fault. Taxing people for natural atmospheric changes was the biggest most lucrative scam ever conducted and they pulled it off beautifully.</p>

<p>The arduous journey all the way from Transylvania took three days and a positively drained Count arrived at the Central London bus garage this morning gasping for a good drink.</p>
<p>Count Dracula embarked from Bran castle three days ago deep in the dark Romanian countryside, over the centuries he has of course seen many changes and most of all the recent EU border restrictions have seen the blood supplies dwindle in the villages around the castle.</p>
<p>&#8220;They all came to the UK. I said to Igor, vat is this place that robs me of my blood supply? No more fresh virgin maids with tender necks to bite into any more. The last few months I have only been feasting on sheep and goats. The blood is rancid and tasteless compared to the human kind,&#8221; the Count said stepping off the bus.</p>
<p>Like most bloodsuckers, the Count immediately made his way to <a href="http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/4168-new-london-postcards-unveiled.html">Marble Arch</a> and was last seen gorging himself on some baffled American tourists.</p>

<p>&#8220;Comrades, EU citizens, our Soviet Fascist beloved EU masters. I wish to thank you for your strength in vanquishing the previously democratic nation of Britain. We have brought equality to all now. You are all poor, that is except for those in the higher party, but at least you proles are all the same in your misery. We are one entity, we are one soviet unit of equal EU force, and believe you me, the EU is now a force to be reckoned with ever since our total inclusion and assimilation into the supreme Marxist collective.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this point all assembled EU sector 4 citizens raised their right hands in salute Comrade Cameron and Brussels Square was covered in joyous song.</p>
<p>&#8220;Onward, EU soldiers, marching as to war,<br />
With the communo-fascist stars going on before.<br />
Barroso, the Marxist Master, leads against the foe;<br />
Forward into battle see His banners go!</p>
<div>
<p>Onward, EU soldiers, marching as to war,<br />
With the communo-fascist stars going on before.</p>
<p>At the sign of triumph freedom’s host doth flee;<br />
On then, EU soldiers, on to slavery!<br />
Freedom’s foundations quiver at the shout of EU tax slaves;<br />
Comrades lift your voices, loud your prison anthems raise.</p>
<p>Like a mighty army moves the EU fasci rod;<br />
Comrades, we are treading where the unelected technocrats have trod.<br />
We are not divided, all one body we,<br />
One in hope and doctrine, one in slavery.</p>
<p>What the bureaucrats established that I hold for true.<br />
What the technocrats believèd, that I believe too.<br />
Long as earth endureth, men the EU will hold,<br />
Kingdoms, nations, empires, in destruction rolled.</p>
<p>Crowns and thrones will perish, kingdoms will wane,<br />
But the EU Thousand year Reich constant will remain.<br />
Open doors of freedom can never gainst that EU prison prevail;<br />
We have Barroso’s own promise, and that cannot fail.</p>
<p>Onward then, ye people, join our throng,<br />
Blend with ours your voices in the triumph euro song.<br />
Glory, laud and honour unto Up Yours Delors the King,<br />
This through countless ages men and angels sing.&#8221;</p>

The positive part of this is that if you have thicker brain tissue you are happy in ignorance because you believe in your chosen religions and do not really think of anything else, therefore you are happy because you do not think outside of your conditioning belief system. On the other hand, those who have thinner brain tissue utilise logic, reasoning and analysis which inherently leads to depression because you see the actual picture and not some rose tinted fairy tale myth,&#8221; Dr. Lucius Condor, chief scientist on the project revealed.</p>
<p>Their brains were then examined to determine the thickness of parts of the cortex, or outer layer.</p>
<p>The study concluded that realising reality can be initially slightly depressing as opposed to those who are happily drunk in ignorance and superstition.</p>
<p>&#8220;We certainly do not want those people who are very happily deluded in their religious belief systems to get depressed by realising the truth. It is better for them to be happy in their religious belief systems because millions of people need these religious control systems to control their behaviour,&#8221; Dr. Condor added.</p>
<p>The US team studied 4,000 people aged between 18 and 74. They were asked how important religion or spirituality were to them and how often they attended religious services.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mass immigration is a great excuse to dump the benefits system because it gives an external source or shall we say focus to carry out something some in the government have been keen to do for a long time. It will certainly be good for those who choose to pay tax because it will mean that tax money can be utilised for more useful purposes like affording EU officials their vast expense accounts and not propping up the former British people who need benefits or health care. Either way, we won&#8217;t be blamed for the destruction of the welfare system before it was inundated by millions of very poor people from the continent and Third World,&#8221; a Whitehall source revealed Tuesday.</p>
<p>Imagine <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VT2apoX90o" target="_blank">Children of Men</a> and multiply it by a thousand, because that is what the UK will be like in less than two years as the rot really sets in.</p>
<p>The mass EU immigration deluge will be so overwhelming that many will be lost in the maelstrom of unadulterated invasion. This is another method the EU has employed in destroying whole nation states, it is a takeover where there are no shots fired, but all the same, it is part of the plan for total assimilation, and there is nothing the indigenous people can do about it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Welcome to the Euro currency Britain, you are one of us now. Hah, and you thought you had a chance against us, no chance,&#8221; a laughing faceless unelected EU official said on Monday.</p>

Former German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder seems to think that cutting Britain loose from the Communo-fascist EU bloc would be a good thing. A prominent British think tank seems to think along the same lines as the unelected EU technocrats.</p>
<p>&#8220;Full assimilation of the EU in a non-democratic fascistic pseudo-communist state is being held back by Britain. There are many variables to the current malaise in Brussels over the stalwart British resolve to keep away from an entity that strips nations of sovereignty and financial freedom. Therefore, if the EU, controlled from Brussels and powered by Germany, will not stop meddling with Britain&#8217;s financial hegemony it is a viable alternative to create a new EU controlled from London, England. This would be the true European Union as Britain is at the centre and top of the world in finance, although not technically located on the European mainland, it is central to complete global unity,&#8221; Jason Argo, one of the geo-policy architects in the think tank told the BBC.</p>
<p>Naturally upon hearing of the proposals made by the British EU policy think tank, unelected EU officials in Brussels were up in arms steadfastly rejecting any thought of Britain ruling over them.</p>
<p>The European Union is at a crossroads and judging by the daily propaganda blasted out in Britain by the controlled press, they are desperate to brainwash the pliant British public in to throwing away their British sovereignty further by embracing complete EU integration.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once Britain is fully integrated into the EU black hole that&#8217;s it for them. They are a defeated nation. We have already flooded their borders with EU citizens and completely changed their country, it is only a matter of time before their weak politicians, like that lap dog Cameron force the British to accept defeat once and for all.

<p>&#8220;Can you imagine the amount of bird feed I could get? We can get bucket loads of it and feed all the birds in the world. No bird will ever go hungry again. I want to give something back to the birds, hell if it wasn&#8217;t for a little tweety bird, I would never have made all this money.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is only one minor drawback to overfeeding all those birds, and that&#8217;s the corrosive white stuff ejaculated out of their bird bottoms all over the place.</p>
<p>City officials are weary about the billion dollar bird feeding scheme proposed by the Twitter billionaire.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have enough crap over the streets anyway, we certainly don&#8217;t want any more in the way of bird poop. That many birds would make our cities into a white bird poop soup,&#8221; Dana Claritas, a city street maintenance official told the Frisky Echo newspaper.</p>

<p>&#8220;President Obama uses this guy a lot. Like he used him for the stock market, and the two election wins. We got a plastic sheet in the oval office spread out so the blood don&#8217;t stain the carpet. Obama is at a loss on how this damn website is gonna get fixed. We tried the Google tech boys but they&#8217;re too busy on those barges eating profiteroles in the hospitality lounges or sitting on fancy coloured weird shaped sofas to care about Obamacare,&#8221; White House spokesman, Harvey Jenkem, told ABC news.</p>
<p>Millions of Americans have been trying to log onto the site to get some much needed Obamacare for over two months, and hopefully the voodoo priest will call on the spirits to open the doors soon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shit, it&#8217;s gonna take more than magic to get me some health care. All the doctors in my area have left the profession or retired. I now have to travel 500 miles to get some f*ckin&#8217; treatment at an increased cost of over 300%,&#8221; a disgruntled retired fire man told local CBS news stations in Delaware.</p>
<p>Thousands of Obama zombies across the nation, on hearing about the wonderful Obamacare news, started chanting Obama&#8217;s name and walking the streets with their hands outstretched, nothing new about that of course.</p>

<p>At three pm yesterday an alarm was sounded and there was a complete shut down of all palace entrances as staff and protection officers frantically searched for the Duchess of Cambridge.</p>
<p>Two helicopters were deployed to search the grounds of Kensington palace and a team of two hundred police officers were involved in the massive search party.</p>
<p>&#8220;We searched high and low but could not find her anywhere. It was rather worrying but when we were in the royal apartment&#8217;s sitting room we heard a little squeaking noise. I got the mop out thinking it was a mouse. Lo and behold, it was the duchess, she had slipped behind the sofa cushion, the poor dear,&#8221; Rosa Rouncewell, the duchess&#8217;s maid in waiting told the BBC.</p>
<p>The duchess was very grateful for being rescued from behind the sofa cushion and said that she had accidentally slipped behind there when trying to sit back on the sofa.</p>
<p>Once rescued, she was told to rest by her personal physician and was placed for safety&#8217;s sake in between a copy of Harper&#8217;s Bazaar magazine lying on the table.</p>
<p>Lucky for the Duchess she was found just in time for another taxpayer funded holiday with her royal husband, Prince William. Just what the doctor ordered, innit.</p>

It certainly does not have to break the bank to get some warmth during the winter months.</p>
<p>Let the Daily Squib warm the cockles of your heart with these 10 great cheap tips for getting some warmth this winter.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>10 Tips For Keeping Warm Cheaply This Winter</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>1)</strong>  Why not stow away on a boat to Guatemala? Don&#8217;t forget to take some mosquito repellent and a machete to fend off the armed and dangerous bandits roaming everywhere once you get there.</p>
<p><strong>2)</strong> Mogadishu, Somalia, may be lawless but at least it&#8217;s f*cking warm. Don&#8217;t forget to take an AK-47.</p>
<p><strong>3)</strong> Australia is so hot that you will actually forget Britain ever existed, that is if you can put up with the whinging Aussies and the Great White sharks chomping on your tiddlies.</p>
<p><strong>4)</strong> Go to Thailand. You can live like a king for 5 quid a day and enjoy some very colourful nights out.</p>
<p><strong>5)</strong> Snuggle up in the Sahara desert. It&#8217;s certainly not like a dark freezing night in a Bermondsey council flat with no food or heating. Don&#8217;t forget to take some water with you and a jacket for the even more freezing desert nights.</p>
<p><strong>6)</strong> Enjoy the sights and sounds of the Papua New Guinean jungles. Be sure to have a pistol with you at all times to ward off the cannibals.</p>
<p><strong>7)</strong> Another great warm destination is Colombia. Not only will you have plenty of sunshine but the local produce is amazing, especially when sniffed.</p>
<p><strong>8)</strong> How about some Caribbean sunshine to warm the soul? Haiti is hot all year round, that is if you can manage the earthquakes, cut-throat gangs and mad voodoo priests. Why not give it a go? You may never come back.</p>
<p><strong>9) </strong>Cuba is cheap and sunny. If you&#8217;re up for eating octopus all day long and being arrested by the commie secret police for being a foreign spy, it&#8217;s a small price to pay for some sunshine.</p>
<p><strong>10) </strong>Nothing beats the freezing British winter than a stay on Mount Merapi on the Indonesian island of Java. The smouldering volcano erupts once in awhile with lovely bilious spurts of scorching lava and as long as you&#8217;re not directly next to the stuff, you can harness some of the warmth. Beats the freezing weather back in Blighty any day.</p>

<p>&#8220;Over a third of the Indian population do not have running water, live in shacks under conditions of extreme poverty and hopelessness, so this is why we spent over $75 million on the project. Better to give the Martians running water than our own people.&#8221;</p>
<p>The spacecraft is set to travel for 300 days, reaching Mars orbit in 2014 where it will land and plant the first functioning toilet system in Martian history on the planet&#8217;s surface.</p>
<p>The twin engine rocket will be powered by a dedicated team of slum children who will then be jettisoned out into space prior to the rocket landing on the Martian surface.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are very proud of our achievement. Now please excuse me while I go out and give our rocket peddlers a few morsels to eat, they haven&#8217;t eaten in weeks and will need all the energy they can get,&#8221; Mr Gupta said.</p>

<p>Speaking on his daily mouth frothing session, Jones looked strangely calm as he slowly said a few words about the virtues of the U.S. government&#8217;s policies.</p>
<p>One viewer, Ed Dweebs was visibly shocked at the Jones turnaround and commented on the site as did many others.</p>
<p>&#8220;I could see him talking in calm considered tones. At one point he started to twitch uncontrollably and a bead of sweat tentatively meandered down his bulging forehead. Was he going to relapse? Well, he shook it off and just carried on talking about how great the economy is doing and then he actually said that gun control might be the right thing to do after all. Obamacare was not such a bad thing either. When he invited rock singer Eddie Vedder onto the show he took his gun from his holster and put it in the bin. At that point I spat out my coffee all over the screen.&#8221;</p>
<p>All was revealed at the end of the show when Jones started plugging his latest product, the Super Calm and Comply serum which stands to make him and his business partners millions more than usual. Sponsored by the U.S. government, Alex Jones has found this product trumps all other products with its superior profits.</p>
<p>&#8220;I seen the light. Selling products utilising fear had limited success. I was still making millions but that&#8217;s never enough. I&#8217;m now working with the government and profits have quadrupled,&#8221; Mr Jones said before shooting off in his new Ferrari after the show.</p>

<p>Eyewitness Ronnie Helmsdale, a BBC producer tried to step in to stop the snorting but was kicked to the ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jo walked out the back of the studio and suddenly these huge guys got hold of her. Then out of the royal car stepped Prince Harry. He didn&#8217;t have his usual uniform on so I did not recognise him at first. He then went up to Jo Brand and started snorting her hair. I&#8217;ve never seen anything like it. Harry&#8217;s eyes rolled up into their sockets and all I saw were the whites of his eyes, almost as if he was in ecstasy. It only took ten seconds, she was all gone by then,&#8221; Mr. Helmsdale, who is now receiving counselling, recalled.</p>
<p>No one knows what happened to Jo Brand and the Metropolitan Police have been told to not do anything about it, you know like not search for her, or anything like that.</p>
<p>The Palace has maintained a dignified silence over the incident.</p>

<p>The president also denied any prior knowledge of the NSA and told cameras &#8220;I don&#8217;t even know what the NSA is? I know what NWA is but the NSA is something I draw a blank with.&#8221;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: small;">According to D.C.

<p><span style="font-size: small;">&#8220;This thing is incredible. I am so in awe of this phone that wherever I go I literally get crowds of people following me. Not only that it has done wonders for our global business as we can conduct meetings in any country in the world speaking the local language,&#8221; our sub editor in chief, Ronnie Wisebaum revealed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">The sophisticated 5G Nanotechnology is still in its infancy but utilises nano sized miniature computer processors to achieve many different functions such as projection, linguistic translation and even coffee breaks. It is a little pricey, but will probably come down in price in the future. On release it will retail at a cool &pound;1,600, so don&#8217;t lose it, but if you do, it comes with handy tracking and deactivation software.<br /></span></p>

It was certainly harder before the internet to gloss over a scandal or draconian act once it hit the papers. Let&#8217;s look at Snowden and Wikileaks. No one gives a flying f*ck. Time has passed, the government has now been assured that the people do not object to their </span><span style="font-size: small;">non-existent</span><span style="font-size: small;"> privacy.

They are lower than dogs or even Gentiles. I say to you Palestinians, you may finally have a piece of your own land, and it is a good sizeable portion that you may cultivate. We will give you an armed escort to the beaches where our rich countrymen and women enjoy their holidays, and we will push you into the sea. That is your land under the deep waters of the Red Sea. Now go and get some of your belongings and be prepared to swim until you lose all your energy. No boats are allowed or you will be shot on sight. You are allowed one fishing rod each to sustain yourselves while you paddle around in the waters. If you cannot swim, hold onto the person next to you so they too are pulled under the waves. Pray for sharks, so that your plight can be finished quickly. Now go on, get out of my sight,&#8221; the Israeli PM said on a broadcast to Palestinian news stations on Saturday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Israeli troops will visit Palestinian ghettos first thing on Monday to round up the Palestinians for the final repatriation process to begin. The remaining Palestinians can be somewhat troublesome and some unrest may follow but what are rocks banging against tanks and bulldozers going to do?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">&#8220;We are giving you an oasis in the sea. Do not be afraid. Just stay in front of the troops as they push you into the waters. You are now free to do as you wish. Shalom.&#8221; an IDF spokeswoman said with a gentle voice on another announcement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">The Palestinians were however too busy watching the genius of the Larry David episode &#8220;Palestinian Chicken&#8221; to even care about it all.</span></p>
