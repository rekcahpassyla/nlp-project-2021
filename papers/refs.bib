abstract = {Online product reviews provide valuable information for consumer decision making. Customers increasingly rely on the reviews and consider them a trusted source of information. For businesses, it is therefore tempting to purchase fake reviews because competitive advantage can be easily achieved by producing positive or negative fake reviews. Machine learning methods have become a critical tool to automatically identify fake reviews. Recently, deep neural networks have shown promising detection accuracy. However, there have been no studies which compare the performance of state-of-the-art deep learning approaches with traditional machine learning methods, such as Na\"{\i}ve Bayes, support vector machines or decision trees. The aim of this study is to examine the performance of several machine learning methods used for the detection of positive and negative fake consumer reviews. Here we show that deep neural networks, including convolutional neural networks and long short term memory, significantly outperform the traditional machine learning methods in terms of accuracy while preserving desirable time performance.},

	abstract = {With the development of the Internet era, more and more consumers are shopping online. Product reviews can influence consumers’ consumption decisions. Fake review detection is a valuable research. From the perspective of research data content, it can be divided into two categories: review content based and review metadata; from the perspective of fake review detection method, it can be divided into four categories: rule-based, graph-based model, machine-learning based and deep learning based. Common data sets are also introduced.}
